The ultimate wake up early motivation.\n\nFirst you need to know how much sleep you need to not feel like shit when you wake up, and know that you can actually get too much sleep and feel lazy for the rest of the day. The perfect amount of sleep is most often between 5-9 hours and I challenge you to set the alarm earlier than you normally would to sleep less than usual just to evaluate how you feel. \n\nOptimize your environment\n\nEliminate sources of light and try to block it all out. Shove the tv out if you have one in your bedroom and instead pick up a book to read. Preferably fiction rather than business or self-help as that will trigger your brain and you’ll get all sorts of cool ideas that will hinder you from falling asleep. \nThere are a lot of techniques you can use to fall asleep faster and wake up fresh, and I’ve made a video about 6 uncommon tips that will definitely speed this process up.\nBut some more common things or tools you can use that will optimize your sleeping environment is white noise machines. It’s a tool that reduces the distracting effect of outsides noises for a more relaxing environment. It’s almost like a heavenly fan without the breeze, just the sound. \nAnd this might sound awful to you but it’s highly effective for falling asleep because you won’t notice those weird random noises that you otherwise would be convinced is the ring girl coming for you.\nAnother tool to wake up fresh is to use wake up light alarm clocks. It will wake you up by first turning on the a light which will increase in brightness, and eventually go over to sounds. Some models have nature sounds and others just normal beeping sounds. It’s a pretty neat way to wake up and takes away that choking beep normal alarms give you.\n\n\nDon’t snooze\n\nDon’t snooze. Don’t ever hit that snooze button man, c'mon you know better than that. I don’t have to explain this much more but just knock fudge out of that alarm clock and let it know who’s the boss, then you want to count from 5 backwards to zero, like you’re taking of with a rocket. Once you reach 0 you’re up and away. It really is that simple and you’ll be up within 10 seconds of the alarm going off. \n\nMe personally, I just go full savage and place my alarm clock on the other side of the room or in the kitchen with full volume. \n\nHave a reason\n\nThe number one thing for making this habit stick is that you should want to get up, just like you wanted to get up for christmas as a kid. You can’t convince yourself to wake up early just because, there has to be a reason for you waking up.\n\nOne thing that get’s me to follow any habit is the checklist manifesto. It’s such a powerful way of getting things done and it’s so easy to implement. All you need to do is to simply create a list of things you want to do the night before you go to bed and put boxes beside every task.\n\nFor instance my first five tasks is to make my bed, do 40 push ups, drink a full glass of water, have a shot of ACV and then take a walk while listening to an audiobook. These five tasks only takes me about 20-25 minutes to accomplish and after that I’ll make some coffee and then I’m fully awake and I go onto some more productive work such as working on these videos.\n\nAnd if you want to be almost as cool as me and listen to audiobooks, you can sign up through my audible link to their 30 day free trial and get 2 books for free. You can cancel the membership any time and still keep the books. Here is the link: https://goo.gl/x64Vb9 \n\nAnd there you go, make sure to implement this tonight already, or since you probably watching this at 2:42 am, try this tomorrow.

My mom has a lot to do with it.\n\nAt six years old we didn't have any money; there was my mother, my brother and I. We had a deadbeat dad; left us before we were two, but she took us at Christmas-time to downtown Los Angeles. We had little cars going around in circles, it was pretty cool, and decorations in the window.\n\nShe gave my brother and I a dime and told us, \"Boys whole half of it each, give it to the man ringing the bell in the bucket.\" We put it in this bucket, we said, \"Mom, why did we give that man a dime? That's like two soda pops.\" This is 1951, two soda pops, three candy bars.\n\nAnd mom said, \"Boys, that's the Salvation Army. They take care of people that have no place to live and no food. And we don't have a lot of money, but we can afford a dime this year. Boys, always remember in life: give a little something to those in need, they'll always be somebody that's not as well-off as you are. No matter where you are or how far down you are, try and help someone along the way.\" It stuck with me.\n\nThe first time I was homeless I was 22-and-a-half years older and I had a two-and-a-half year old son. I was working as the Master of Ceremonies at the Second Annual Sports Vacation Recreational Vehicle Show and I had a check coming in at the end of the week.\n\nWell, I came home and I drove our one car up to where we lived and as I was getting out of the car and going up towards our apartment door my wife—we were very young, we got married at 20 and 19 years old—my wife was coming down the stairs and she said, \"I'm going to storage,\" and she took the keys. By the time I got through the door I saw my little boy, two and a half years old, kind of just sitting there on top of a pile of clothes with a note that basically said, “I can't handle being a mom anymore. He'll be much better off with you. Good luck.”\n\nNow, what I didn't know also was that she had planned this for a few months. She had not paid the rent for a few months and kept the money and I didn't know that. She wiped out what little we had in the savings account in the bank and took the only car we had. So unbeknownst to me, two days later I was evicted—completely evicted, power shut off, the landlord—she just really timed this one. And I had this little kid with me, two-and-a-half years old, and now I had to be mom and dad and that was really a bummer, I had no car! So I ended up borrowing a 1951 Cadillac with a broken water pump from someone that was very, very dear, had to put water in it every four hours, and that's kind of how we got going.\n\nSecond time I was homeless is when I started John Paul Mitchell Systems. I knew I needed $500,000 to start John Paul Mitchell Systems, had to have that. So we had the backer lined up, I had a good job at the time, lived in a nice house, and I left everything I had because $500,000 was coming down the street, I was going to start a company. So I left it all behind. I left what money I had with my wife—we weren't getting along well at all—and the best car. And I took the older car—it was a good one but an older car, it ran good—down the hill to get my money.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZpV24tltyME/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZpV24tltyME/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZpV24tltyME/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZpV24tltyME/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZpV24tltyME/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Big Think","tags":["Big Think","BigThink","BigThink.com","Education","Educational","Lifelong Learning","EDU","jean paul dejoria","homelessness","billionaire","charity","giving back"],"categoryId":"27","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"How I Overcame Homelessness Twice to Become a Billionaire | John Paul DeJoria","description":"John Paul Dejoria has had a rough ride to the top.

From the outset there were the landowners, the ruling class - the \"haves\". And then there were the have-nots.

The success and reach of my previous film(youtu.be/j2hNaT56FUY) - made the news in over 40 countries and published on National Geographic, inspired me to make a follow up to help people even better relate to night skies and further raise awareness on light pollution.\n\nOne thing I realized from my last film was that people were able to relate to the difference between the light pollution levels but not the Milky Way itself. The Milky Way appears more colorful to a camera than it does to our eyes and most people haven’t seen it. But, the Orion is a more common sight. It’s a great subject to help explain light pollution.\n\nAstronomy is a humbling and character building experience like Carl Sagan puts it. Being under a sky full of stars makes you feel tiny, humble, kind and caring. But, thanks to light pollution, most people lack this connection. Millions of kids are robbed of finding their passion for Astronomy. We've lost the potential for thousands of great minds. We are losing our identity only increasing the difference between us.\n\nIn less than hundred years, we have drastically altered our night time environment. Light pollution affects our health, disrupts our sleep patterns, increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, hormonal disorders and other diseases. Millions of birds are killed each year colliding into brightly lit buildings. Baby sea turtles(hatchlings) are often confused by bright lights and never make it to the sea. And we've only begun to understand the effects. But, fortunately, there are ways to fix it.\n\nThe International Dark Sky Association recommends using shielded lighting, low color temperature LEDs(2700K and less), motion sensors for safety than leaving lights on all night. Unshielded bright LEDs create a lot of glare and impairs vision. Several cities and municipalities have recently switched to dark sky friendly lighting and people are welcoming the change - they’ve hardly noticed any difference in lighting and in fact, hated harsh bright lights. Tucson, Phoenix, Montreal, the state of Georgia are all examples. It makes me really happy and optimistic hearing these success stories. Fighting light pollution does not mean turning all your lights off, it’s about being wise with our lighting choices.\n\nWhat can we do ourselves? Start by inspecting the lighting in our homes.

The success and reach of my previous film(youtu.be/j2hNaT56FUY) - made the news in over 40 countries and published on National Geographic, inspired me to make a follow up to help people even better relate to night skies and further raise awareness on light pollution.\n\nOne thing I realized from my last film was that people were able to relate to the difference between the light pollution levels but not the Milky Way itself. The Milky Way appears more colorful to a camera than it does to our eyes and most people haven’t seen it. But, the Orion is a more common sight. It’s a great subject to help explain light pollution.\n\nAstronomy is a humbling and character building experience like Carl Sagan puts it. Being under a sky full of stars makes you feel tiny, humble, kind and caring. But, thanks to light pollution, most people lack this connection. Millions of kids are robbed of finding their passion for Astronomy. We've lost the potential for thousands of great minds. We are losing our identity only increasing the difference between us.\n\nIn less than hundred years, we have drastically altered our night time environment. Light pollution affects our health, disrupts our sleep patterns, increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, hormonal disorders and other diseases. Millions of birds are killed each year colliding into brightly lit buildings. Baby sea turtles(hatchlings) are often confused by bright lights and never make it to the sea. And we've only begun to understand the effects. But, fortunately, there are ways to fix it.\n\nThe International Dark Sky Association recommends using shielded lighting, low color temperature LEDs(2700K and less), motion sensors for safety than leaving lights on all night. Unshielded bright LEDs create a lot of glare and impairs vision. Several cities and municipalities have recently switched to dark sky friendly lighting and people are welcoming the change - they’ve hardly noticed any difference in lighting and in fact, hated harsh bright lights. Tucson, Phoenix, Montreal, the state of Georgia are all examples. It makes me really happy and optimistic hearing these success stories. Fighting light pollution does not mean turning all your lights off, it’s about being wise with our lighting choices.\n\nWhat can we do ourselves? Start by inspecting the lighting in our homes.

Then, look for bright unshielded lights on nearby streets, parking lots, etc. Raise awareness on the issue, get help from the IDA to make your city write lighting ordinances. Together, we can fight pollution and have our night skies and our identity back.\n\nContact: srirammurali.com/contact/\nMusic: Imagine by Ryan Taubert\nCopyright All Rights Reserved"}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT2M15S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":false,"projection":"rectangular"},"statistics":{"viewCount":72488,"likeCount":2300,"dislikeCount":53,"favoriteCount":0,"commentCount":166},"ratio":43.39622641509434,"score":3145705.6603773586,"_id":"2r1f2P2KNLRjpQjv","watched":true}

(See below for a shopping list, tools, and steps.)\n\nClick here to SUBSCRIBE to the official This Old House YouTube channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=thisoldhouse\n\nShopping List for How to Choose and Use a Blowtorch:\n- Solder\n- Flux\n- Emery cloth\n- Brush\n- Flint (if needed)\n\nTools for How to Choose and Use a Blowtorch:\n- Propane-fueled torch\n- MAPP-gas-fueled torch\n\nSteps for How to Choose and Use a Blowtorch:\n1. Richard says your choice of blowtorch depends on the type of job you are doing. \n2. For smaller jobs involving ½-inch copper pipe, it’s best to use a pencil-tipped propane-fueled torch. \n3. For larger jobs involving copper pipe ¾ inch or more, it’s best to use a hotter flame from the MAPP-gas-fueled torch. \n4. To make a copper-pipe connection: Clean the outside of the pipe and the inside of the fitting with an emery cloth. \n5. Apply flux to the pipes and make the connection. \n6.

(See below for a shopping list, tools, and steps.)\n\nClick here to SUBSCRIBE to the official This Old House YouTube channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=thisoldhouse\n\nShopping List for How to Choose and Use a Blowtorch:\n- Solder\n- Flux\n- Emery cloth\n- Brush\n- Flint (if needed)\n\nTools for How to Choose and Use a Blowtorch:\n- Propane-fueled torch\n- MAPP-gas-fueled torch\n\nSteps for How to Choose and Use a Blowtorch:\n1. Richard says your choice of blowtorch depends on the type of job you are doing. \n2. For smaller jobs involving ½-inch copper pipe, it’s best to use a pencil-tipped propane-fueled torch. \n3. For larger jobs involving copper pipe ¾ inch or more, it’s best to use a hotter flame from the MAPP-gas-fueled torch. \n4. To make a copper-pipe connection: Clean the outside of the pipe and the inside of the fitting with an emery cloth. \n5. Apply flux to the pipes and make the connection. \n6. Apply the tip of the flame to the flux connection. \n7. Once the flux begins to melt and drip, place solder on the opposite side away from the flame. \n8. The flame will draw the solder all the way around. \n9. Once the solder is drawn around, remove the flame from the pipe and let the connection cool. \n\nFollow This Old House and Ask This Old House: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ThisOldHouse\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/thisoldhouse\nhttps://twitter.com/asktoh\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/thisoldhouse/\nG+: https://plus.google.com/+thisoldhouse/posts\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/thisoldhouse\nTumblr: http://thisoldhouse.tumblr.com/"}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT3M35S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":true,"projection":"rectangular"},"statistics":{"viewCount":151753,"likeCount":1082,"dislikeCount":35,"favoriteCount":0,"commentCount":54},"ratio":30.914285714285715,"score":4691335.6,"_id":"3mBsM28J7DwV9rPN"}

The area's transformation happened gradually, over a period of more than 100 years. Here's how.\n\nSilicon Valley is an almost $3 trillion neighborhood thanks to companies like Apple, Google, and Tesla. But it wasn't always this way.\n\nIn the late 1800s, San Francisco's port helped make it a hub of the early telegraph and radio industries. In 1909, San José became home to one of the US's first radio stations. In 1933, the Navy purchased Moffett Field to dock and maintain the USS Macon. This made Moffett Field a major hub for the early days of the aerospace industry. Many scientists and researchers all found work in the area. In 1939, the Ames Research Center was founded in the area, and it became home to the world's largest wind tunnel in 1949.\n\nAlso in 1939, William Hewlett and Dave Packard founded Hewlett-Packard in Palo Alto, which originally made oscilloscopes. Then, during World War II, HP made radar and artillery technology. At this point, computers were about the size of a room.\n\nIn the 1940s, William Shockley coinvented the transistor while at Bell Labs. The transistor is now known as the computer processor. In 1956, Shockley left Bell and founded his own company — Shockley Semiconductor Labs. It was the first company to make transistors out of silicon and not germanium. The company was founded in Mountain View, California — so Shockley could be closer to his sick mother. Shockley's company employed many recent grads of Stanford.\n\nIn 1957, eight Shockley employees grew tired of his demeanor and left the company. Shockley called the group the \"Traitorous Eight.\" They partnered with Sherman Fairchild to create Fairchild Semiconductor. In the early 1960s, Fairchild helped make computer components for the Apollo program. Later in the decade, many of the \"Traitorous Eight\" left Fairchild and founded their own companies. Including Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, who in 1968 founded their own company in Santa Clara called Intel. Soon after, other ex-Fairchild employees and \"Traitorous Eight\" members helped found AMD, Nvidia, and venture fund Kleiner Perkins.\n\nIn 1969, the Stanford Research Institute became one of the four nodes of ARPANET. A government research project that would go on to become the internet. In 1970, Xerox opened its PARC lab in Palo Alto. PARC invented early computing tech, including ethernet computing and the graphical user interface. In 1971, journalist Don Hoefler titled a 3-part report on the semiconductor industry \"SILICON VALLEY USA.\" The name stuck.\n\nIn the 1970s, companies like Atari, Apple, and Oracle were all founded in the area In the 1980s, Silicon Valley became the widely accepted center of the computer industry. eBay, Yahoo, PayPal, and Google are just some of the companies founded in the area in the 1990s With Facebook, Twitter, Uber, and Tesla joining them the following decade.

(See below for a shopping list, tools, and steps.)\n\nClick here to SUBSCRIBE to the official This Old House YouTube channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=thisoldhouse\n\nShopping List for Building a Storage Bench:\n- 1/2-inch and 3/4-inch cabinet-grade birch plywood\n- 1x3 and 1x8 poplar\n- Crown molding\n- Two wicker storage baskets\n- 4 Decorative coat hooks\n- Carpenters' glue\n- Cloth rag, for wiping off excess glue\n- 1 1/4-inch pocket screws, used to join rails to stiles\n- 1-inch screws, for attaching stiles and rails to the plywood back of the bench\n- 2 1/2-inch drywall screws, used to assemble the storage box\n- 1 1/2-inch brads, used to join together the legs\n- 120-grit abrasive disks\n- 1-inch pins, for securing the crown molding\n- Primer and latex paint or wood stain\n\nTools List for Building a Storage Bench:\n- Table saw, for ripping plywood to width\n- Track saw, used to crosscut plywood to length\n- Miter saw, for cutting poplar parts to length\n- Pocket-hole jig, used to bore pocket holes\n- Clamps, for holding parts during pocket joinery\n- Drill/driver\n- Impact driver, used to drive screws\n- Router with quarter-round stepped-beading router bit, for shaping edges\n- Wet/dry vacuum, used to collect dust\n- Jigsaw, for cutting a radius into each leg\n- Pneumatic brad nailer\n- Random-orbit sander\n- Pneumatic pin nailer\n\nSteps for Building a Storage Bench:\n1. Rip the plywood parts to width using a table saw.\n2. Crosscut the plywood parts to length with a track saw.\n3. Use a miter saw to crosscut the poplar stiles and rails to length.\n4. Drill holes into the rails using a pocket-hole jig.\n5. Screw the rails to the stiles with 1 1/4-inch pocket screws.\n6. Glue and screw the stiles and rails to the plywood back with 1-inch screws.\n7. Use a router and a quarter-round stepped-beading router bit to shape the inside edges of the stiles and rails.\n8. Notch the rear top and bottom corners of the plywood center divider for the storage box.\n9. Screw together the plywood storage box with 2 1/2-inch drywall screws.

The insert has to withstand extreme heat and force, so it’s made of some of the hardest material in the world. \n\nWe take you to the Sandvik Coromant's world class insert production facility at Gimo, Sweden to witness how an insert is made. See how it's done!\n\nTranscript\nAlmost everything made of metal is machined with an insert. The insert has to withstand extreme heat and force, so it’s made of some of the hardest material in the world.\n\nA typical insert is made of 80% tungsten carbide and a metal matrix that binds the hard carbide grains together, where cobalt is the most common. It takes more than two days to produce an insert, so it’s a complicated process. \n\nIn the material warehouse, row after row of raw material are stacked. The tungsten carbide we use is either recycled, or comes from our own mine in Austria. Cobalt, titanium and all other ingredients come from carefully selected suppliers; each batch meticulously tested in the lab.\n\nSome recipes contain very small amounts of selected ingredients that are added by hand. The main ingredients are then automatically dispensed at the different stops along the weigh line. \n\nIn the milling room the ingredients are milled to the required particle size together with ethanol, water and an organic binder. This process takes from eight to 55 hours, depending on the recipe.\n\nThe slurry is pumped into a spray drier where hot nitrogen gas is sprayed to evaporate the ethanol and water mixture. When the powder is dry, it consists of spherical granules of identical sizes. A sample is sent to the lab for quality check.\n\nBarrels of 100 kilograms of ready-to-press powder arrive at the pressing machine. The binder added in the milling room is the binder that holds the powder together after pressing. Up to 12 tons of pressure are applied, depending on the type of insert. The binder added in the milling room is what holds the powder together after pressing. The process is completely automated. Each insert is weighed and at certain intervals controlled visually by the operator.\n\nThe pressed inserts are very fragile and need to be hardened in a sintering oven. This process takes about 13 hours at a temperature of approximately 1,500 degrees Celsius. The inserts are sintered into an extremely hard cemented-carbide product, almost as hard as diamond. The organic binder is incinerated and the insert shrinks approximately to half its original size. The excess heat is recycled and used to heat the premises in the winter, and cool them down during summer.\n\nThe inserts are ground, one by one, in different types of grinding machines to achieve the exact size, geometry and tolerances. As the cemented carbide insert is so hard, a disc with 150 million small industrial diamonds, is used to grind it. The excess carbide is recycled, as well as the oil that is used as cutting fluid.\n\nThe majority of inserts are coated, either through chemical vapour deposition (CVD) or physical vapour deposition (PVD). Here, we see a PVD-process. \nThe inserts are placed in fixtures...  \n…and put into the oven. \nThe thin layer of coating makes the insert both harder and tougher. This is also where the insert gets its specific colour.\n\nAlthough the insert has been inspected at the lab regularly during the whole process, it’s manually examined again before it’s laser marked and packed. \nAfter labelling, the grey boxes are ready to be sent out to manufacturers around the world.\n\nWhen the inserts are worn out, they are returned to Sandvik Coromant for recycling, and the process of making a new insert begins.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0QrynzJ_lZ4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0QrynzJ_lZ4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0QrynzJ_lZ4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0QrynzJ_lZ4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0QrynzJ_lZ4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Sandvik Coromant","tags":["How inserts are made","carbide inserts","inserts","grades","inserts and grades","turning","milling","drilling","metalworking","machining metal","Gimo","Sandvik Coromant","recycling","wolfram","automation","tungsten","tungsten inserts","tungsten carbide inserts","how to make a carbide insert","cemented carbide"],"categoryId":"28","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"How carbide inserts are made by Sandvik Coromant","description":"Carbide inserts are used to machine almost  everything made of metal.

Use a gas-powered cut-off saw or angle grinder to cut stone.\n2. To hand-split a stone, begin by using an electric rotary hammer and masonry bit to drill holes spaced 4 inches apart across the stone face.\n3. Insert a steel wedge and pair of steel feathers (shims) into each hole.\n4. Use a hammer to alternately tap each wedge into the hole.\n5. Continue to lightly tap each wedge until the stone cracks in two.\n6. To split a stone with a hand tracer, set the tracer on top of the stone and tap it with the hammer. Move the tracer down an inch or so and strike it again.\n7. Continue in this fashion until you’ve a cut line across the stone.\n8. Move the hand tracer back to the beginning and repeat, tap it, move it, tap it, move it, until the stone splits in two.\n9. To crack large stones, use a stonebuster tool.

Of course, any history of the fallout shelter has to include nuclear proliferation, civil defense, Presidential politics, and a turtle named Bert.\n\nThe video above serves as a condensed history of the Cold War’s fallout shelter fad, from the kookily cheerful propaganda videos to the hobbled Federal agencies that tried to administer Civil Defense. Yes, it includes the classic Cold War film Duck and Cover, in which a bomb-fearing turtle named Bert teaches kids that hiding under their desks could be sufficient protection from nuclear annihilation.\nAny history of fallout shelter culture (and Cold War propaganda) becomes an indirect history of Cold War nuclear escalation, from Hiroshima-sized bombs to hydrogen behemoths. As the nuclear threat increased in magnitude, the absurdity of civil defense amped up simultaneously.\nThis video (and a day spend trawling the Internet Archive for darkly humorous videos) provides a more intimate portrait of Cold War paranoia as it was lived.

You sit down and you focus on it. So you focus and you’re activating task-positive networks. And then what happens is you’re working away and then you start to get frustrated. You can’t figure out what’s going on. What’s happening is you’re focusing and you’re using one small area of your brain to analyze the material. But it isn’t the right circuit to actually understand and comprehend the material. So you get frustrated. You finally give up, and then when you give up and get your attention off it it turns out that you activate a completely different type of or set of neural circuits. That’s the default mode network and the related neural circuits. So what happens is you stop thinking about it, you relax, you go off for a walk, you take a shower. You’re doing something different. And in the background this default mode network is doing some sort of neural processing on the side. And then what happens is you come back and voila, suddenly the information makes sense. And, in fact, it can suddenly seem so easy that you can’t figure out why you didn’t understand it before. So learning often involves going back and forth between these two different neural modes – focus mode and what I often call diffuse mode which involves **** resting states. You can only be in one mode at the same time\n\nSo you might wonder, is there a certain task that is more appropriate for focus mode or diffuse mode? The reality is that learning involves going back and forth between these two modes. You often have to focus at first in order to sort of load that information into your brain and then you do something different, get your attention off it and that’s when that background processing occurs. And this happens no matter what you’re learning. Whether you’re learning something in math and science, you’re learning a new language, learning music, a dance. Even learning to back up a car. And think about it this way. Here’s a very important related idea and that is that when you’re learning something new you want to create a well practiced neural pattern that you can easily draw to mind when you need it. So this is called a neural chunk and chunking theory is incredibly important in learning. So, for example, if you are trying to learn to back up a car when you first begin it’s crazy, right. You’re looking all around. Do you look in this mirror or this mirror or do you look behind you? What do you do? It’s this crazy set of information. But after you’ve practiced a while you develop this very nice sort of pattern that’s well practiced. So all you have to do is think I’m going to back up a car. Instantly that pattern comes to mind and you’re able to back up a car. Not only are you doing that but you’re maybe talking to friends, listening to the radio. It’s that well practiced neural chunk that makes it seem easy. So it’s important in any kind of learning to create these well practiced patterns. And the bigger the library of these patterns, the more well practiced sort of deeper and broader they are as neural patterns in your mind, the more expertise you have in that topic. \n\nAnd chunking was first sort of thought of or explored by Nobel Prize Winner [Herbert] Simon who found that, if you’re a chess master, that the higher you’re ranking in chess, the more patterns of chess you have memorized. So you could access more and more patterns of chess.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1FvYJhpNvHY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1FvYJhpNvHY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1FvYJhpNvHY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1FvYJhpNvHY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1FvYJhpNvHY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Big Think","tags":["Big Think","BigThink","BigThink.com","Education","Educational","Lifelong Learning","EDU","barbara oakley","neural networks","brain","neuroscience","neural chunking"],"categoryId":"27","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"The Science of Learning: How to Turn Information into Intelligence | Barbara Oakley","description":"Cramming for a test and having a hard time understanding something?

I think we’re a nation of hard workers.\n\nAnd that being said I think sometimes we reach down too far into our youth and expect them to produce sooner than they should be able to.\n\nI think people gain a tremendous amount of wisdom when they travel, when they wander—when they allow themselves, as I did, to get lost. And maybe you’ll find yourself somewhere. Or at least traveling forces you to be social. You have to get directions, you have to learn where things are, you’re attuned to your environment, you have to be more careful about the weather and where you’re lodging is going to be, where you’re going to eat, how you’re going to get from one place to another.\n\nWhen you’re there what is it you want to see? How can you find a place for you to actually just rest? It’s an experience like no other. I love to travel and I enjoy not knowing where I am. It’s an unusual thing. I’d purposefully teach that to my daughter, who’s now 24 years old, to not be afraid of not knowing where you are. So I’ll go for a drive or go for a walk in a different city and my wife will say, “Do you know where you’re going?” “Not really. Just kind of exploring different places.” As long as you have a sense of direction you’ll find your way, you’ll figure it out. And I do that in foreign countries as well: Just kind of wander and meander and trust that you’ve paid attention to at least the basic requirement of where you have to get back to in order to find your way home.\n\nBut I think it is, I think we look down now to 16 year olds and say, “Where are you going to go to college? What are you going to do for the rest of your life?” And it's like... they’re not fully baked yet! How do they know? Give them a break.\n\nJust say, look, “I think after high school take a year off, take two years off. Join the Peace Corps. Travel. Go figure things out or just enjoy yourself.”\n\nFor the first time in their lives they’re adults and they don’t have to be somewhere. They’re not told to be somewhere. Get used to that freedom. Get used to having the need to self-govern yourself, to be able to employ self-discipline—or not. Or you realize “Oh my god, I’m really slovenly! If I’m not told I need to go to class I don’t go.” You might discover something about yourself.\n\n“I need order. I need that. I like that.” Some people love to be, say, “this is where you have to be and this is what you need to do.” Are you that type of person or are you a type of person that wants more freedom in your life? And I think exploration, travel, it provides that.\n\nIn 1976 I had just finished my second year of college and realized that, after an experience in an elective acting class, that I wasn’t going to be the policeman I thought I was going to be. It was better if I didn’t continue on with two more years of an Administration of Justice major because I knew I wasn’t going to become a policeman.\n\nSo... I thought I better just go figure out what it is I want to do.\n\nAnd so I hopped on the back of a motorcycle. My brother was in the same position, really. Two young guys who were not quite sure what was in store for them or what avenue they should go down. So we both hopped on our motorcycles and we took off. We left California. I had about 150 bucks in my pocket or something.

We then thawed half of each steak in the refrigerator overnight and kept the other half frozen. Using our preferred method, we seared both sets of steaks in a hot skillet for 90 seconds per side and then transferred them to a 275-degree oven until they reached 125 degrees, or medium-rare. To track moisture loss, we weighed each steak before and after cooking.\n\nRESULTS\n\nNot surprisingly, the frozen steaks took longer to finish cooking through in the oven (18 to 22 minutes versus 10 to 15 minutes for the thawed steaks). What was surprising was that the frozen steaks actually browned in the skillet just as well as, and in the same amount of time as, the thawed steaks. Furthermore, they had thinner bands of gray, overcooked meat directly under the crust than the thawed steaks had. We also found that these steaks lost on average 9 percent less moisture during cooking than the thawed steaks did. Sampling the steaks side by side, tasters unanimously preferred the cooked-from-frozen steaks to their thawed counterparts.\n\nEXPLANATION\n\nA fully frozen steak is extremely cold, which prevents overcooking while the surface reaches the very high temperatures necessary for browning reactions. As for the difference in moisture loss, we know that when meat is cooked to temperatures higher than 140 degrees, its muscle fibers begin to squeeze out a significant amount of moisture. As its slightly thicker gray band indicated, the steak that had been thawed had more overcooking around the edge, so it made sense that it also had greater moisture loss.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nWhile we prefer to start with steak that’s never been frozen for the best texture, if we do have frozen steaks on hand, from now on we’ll cook them straight from the freezer. (But if you can choose between frozen vs. fresh, definitely go for fresh.)\n\nHere's what to do for the best frozen steaks: Freeze steaks, uncovered, overnight on a baking sheet (this dries them out to prevent excess splattering during cooking), then wrap them tightly in plastic wrap, place in a zipper-lock bag, and return to freezer. To ensure that the steaks brown evenly, add oil to the skillet until it measures 1/8 inch deep.

The A press is to perform AB kicks on the rising elevators. Without doing these kicks, Mario would go through the elevator, and so there'd be no way to navigate out of the lake area with QPU speed. For the record, this is TAS.\n\nThis video is an improvement from my previous video in which I collected this star in 1 A press. You can find that video here: https://youtu.be/yGic8wwhm6g. Since then, we discovered PU movement and scuttlebug raising, which made this strat possible.\n\nFor convenience, here are the informative parts of the video:\n0:35 for half A presses\n3:44 for scuttlebug transportation\n5:01 for scuttlebug raising\n8:07 for hyper speed walking (HSWing)\n10:40 for parallel universes (PUs)\n\nHere is a play by play of what I do. First, I use scuttlebug transportation to move a scuttlebug to the corner of the Watch for Rolling Rocks platform. Then, I use scuttlebug raising to raise him to about the height of the platform. Next, I use hyper speed walking to generate massive speed. Finally, I use PU movement to navigate to the top of the course, launch to the scuttlebug to bounce on him, and ground pound in the misalignment of the platform to get onto it. And from there, I collect the star.\n\nIf you want to see my workspace/calculations and read about the process of TASing this, I've chronicled it here: http://imgur.com/gallery/rK24p\n\n.m64 stats:\nLength: 13 hours and 49.5 minutes\nRe-records: 6824\nFrames: 2986271 (1493100 input)\n\nThis video is without a doubt the one that I've put the most time into out of all my videos.

The A press is to perform AB kicks on the rising elevators. Without doing these kicks, Mario would go through the elevator, and so there'd be no way to navigate out of the lake area with QPU speed. For the record, this is TAS.\n\nThis video is an improvement from my previous video in which I collected this star in 1 A press. You can find that video here: https://youtu.be/yGic8wwhm6g. Since then, we discovered PU movement and scuttlebug raising, which made this strat possible.\n\nFor convenience, here are the informative parts of the video:\n0:35 for half A presses\n3:44 for scuttlebug transportation\n5:01 for scuttlebug raising\n8:07 for hyper speed walking (HSWing)\n10:40 for parallel universes (PUs)\n\nHere is a play by play of what I do. First, I use scuttlebug transportation to move a scuttlebug to the corner of the Watch for Rolling Rocks platform. Then, I use scuttlebug raising to raise him to about the height of the platform. Next, I use hyper speed walking to generate massive speed. Finally, I use PU movement to navigate to the top of the course, launch to the scuttlebug to bounce on him, and ground pound in the misalignment of the platform to get onto it. And from there, I collect the star.\n\nIf you want to see my workspace/calculations and read about the process of TASing this, I've chronicled it here: http://imgur.com/gallery/rK24p\n\n.m64 stats:\nLength: 13 hours and 49.5 minutes\nRe-records: 6824\nFrames: 2986271 (1493100 input)\n\nThis video is without a doubt the one that I've put the most time into out of all my videos. I knew this going in, and so I decided to keep a log of how much time I spent on each aspect of it (note: if my computer was doing work like compiling/recording and I could let it be, I didn't count that time).

Pattern matching\n\nIf the pattern is matched on the sleeve and the shoulder on both sides, you know it's a quality shirt because someone paid attention to it.\n\n2. Stitching\n\nThe higher the stitch density, the higher the quality of the shirt overall. Also, you want to look for consistency of the stitching. The best way to look at the stitching is at the bottom hem where it's round.\n\nA quality shirt will always have a single needle stitching which takes a little more time but creates a cleaner look. On the other hand, a low-end shirt will double needle stitching\n\n3. Collar and the cuffs\n\nA lower end shirt will typically have a stiff interlining in the collar and it just comes in one level of stiffness. On the other hand, a higher end shirt will either give you an option to go with a softer interlining or something stiffer.\n\n4. Yoke\n\nTraditionally, they were split in half because people usually have one shoulder that is usually more sloped than the other and they use that part to correct that. Today, most factory made shirts and even made to measure shirts don't even take that into consideration anymore so all you can look at is the yoke split in the back. if so, it's another step, it's more expensive, it helps to match the pattern on the sleeve and it's basically all it is.\n\n5. Buttons\n\nA $30 shirt will likely have plastic buttons and they're sometimes made to look like mother of pearl.  \n\nThe next detail to look at is how the button is actually sewn onto the shirt.\n\n6. Sleeves\n\nMost of the time, relatively inexpensive shirts or low-end shirts have huge armholes and that makes them uncomfortable to wear because as soon as you lift your arms, everything moves up and becomes uncomfortable.\n\n7. Buttonholes\n\nIf you have a machine buttonhole that was first sewn and then cut, you have fraying edges on the inside and it just looks bad. On the other hand, a high-quality machine sewn buttonhole has a very high stitch density and you will not find fraying threads. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMost Popular videos: \nHow to accept a compliment - https://youtu.be/_EKXNmM1PUo\n101 things that change when you dress up - https://youtu.be/JyGDd_iYaCI\nHow to tie a Bow Tie - https://youtu.be/2I3cfa0BOOc\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWant to stay updated?

Before starting work, remove or protect any furniture in the room with drop cloths. Protect where the floor meets the wall with painter’s tape.\n2. When painting, always start at the top of the room and work your way down. Always pour paint into a separate container. \n3. Paint the ceiling with a matte paint and the roller.\n4. Paint the trim, including window trim, chair rails, and door casings with a semi-gloss paint and a 1 ½” synthetic paint brush. Start from the top and work down.\n5. For painting around windows, apply a liquid mask to the glass with a paint brush instead of using painter’s tape. The liquid acts like a spot primer if it gets on the sash, and it will protect the glass while painting.\n6. Once the mask turns clear, add a second coat and wait for that to turn clear as well.\n7. Paint the window frame, starting from the inside closest to the glass, and work your way out. To keep paint from getting into the cracks between the window and the jamb, slide a putty knife in the crack and drag it down as you paint.  Add a paint additive if necessary to thin out the paint being applied around the windows.\n8. Once the window frame is painted, paint the casing, then the window sill. For the side of the casing, keep the brush parallel to the wall and drag the brush all the way down the side of the casing.\n9. Apply a second coat to the window trim, chair rails, and door casings.\n10. Paint the walls using eggshell paint in most rooms. Low traffic rooms, like a bedroom, can use a matte finish.\n11. Cut the edges around the walls with a 2 ½” synthetic brush. Carefully drag the brush in a motion away from the ceiling and trim to prevent it from spilling over.\n12. Paint the rest of the walls with a microfiber roller.\n13. Before applying the final coat, using paintable caulking to fill in any gaps between trim, baseboards, etc.\n14. Apply a second coat to the walls.\n15. Clean up the drop cloths and painter’s tape. To remove the liquid mask, cut around the glass with a utility knife and peel it back slowly.\n\nResources:\nAll the painting supplies Mauro used on this project, including the brushes, rollers, drop clothes, and paint additive, can all be found at home centers and paint supply stores.\n\nMauro painted the room using Behr Marquee paint (http://www.behr.com/consumer/marquee-interior-collection).

Drill a hole through the chipped part of the floor using a countersink bit. Drop a little bit of water in the hole, then add some polyurethane glue.\n2. Drive a screw through the hole, securing the floorboard back to the floor.\n3. If you saved the chipped piece of the floor, you can glue it back on the floor with wood glue. Be sure to cover all the exposed wood with glue before re-securing the patch.\n4. Wipe off any excess glue on the patch with a wet rag.\n5. If you don’t have the chipped piece or it doesn’t fit back into the hole perfectly, you’ll need to make a Dutchman. Examine the floorboard and find a section of it that matches the grain around the rest of the floor boards near the chip.\n6. True up the edge of the floorboard chosen for the patch using a block plane.\n7. Cut the patch roughly to size using a hand saw. First, rip the patch to rough width. Then rip the patch in half so it’s half the thickness of the floorboard.\n8. Square one end of the Dutchman using the block plane.\n9. Hold the Dutchman up to the section of the floor requiring the patch. Mark the length just slightly past where the chip ends.\n10. Cut the Dutchman to length based on the mark.\n11. Hold the Dutchman over the chip. Trace around the outside of the patch using the utility knife.\n12. Chisel out the outlined section of the floor roughly the thickness of the patch. To save time, you can use a drill with a forstner bit and then switch to the hand chisel for fine tuning.\n13. Pitch the Dutchman at an angle and shave off a little bevel on each side with the block plane so the patch will fit easier in the floor.\n14. Once the Dutchman fits the hole, prestain it with a rag. Let the stain sit for about five minutes.\n15. Stain the Dutchman with a rag. Let it dry for a few minutes.\n16. Apply wood glue to the hole in the floor. Make sure all the raw wood is covered with glue. Wipe off excess glue with a rag.\n17. Tape around the patch and let it sit overnight. After about 24 hours, add a few coats of polyurethane until the patch blends in with the rest of the floor.\n\nResources:\nEverything Tom used for this project, including the hand saw, block plane, utility knife, and stain, can be found at home centers.\n\nTom used flooring saved by the homeowner, but flooring can also be found at home centers, lumber yards, and flooring retailers. For a patch, use the same type of wood and look for a piece that has a similar grain to the floor being patched.\n\nTom secured the Dutchman to the floor using wood glue and polyurethane glue, both manufactured by Gorilla Glue (http://www.gorillatough.com/).\n\nThe workbench Tom made the Dutchman on is manufactured by Kreg (https://www.kregtool.com/).\n\nFollow This Old House and Ask This Old House: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ThisOldHouse\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/thisoldhouse\nhttps://twitter.com/asktoh\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/thisoldhouse/\nG+: https://plus.google.com/+thisoldhouse/posts\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/thisoldhouse\nTumblr: http://thisoldhouse.tumblr.com/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DPGxCageub8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DPGxCageub8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DPGxCageub8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DPGxCageub8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DPGxCageub8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"This Old House","tags":["this old house","how-to","home improvement","Episode","TV Show","DIY","how-to patch","chipped wood floor","floor","flooring","Tom Silva","dutchman","hand tools"],"categoryId":"26","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"How to Patch a Chipped Wood Floor","description":"Watch the full episode: https://www.thisoldhouse.com/watch/ask-toh-walkway-reset-chipped-floor\n\nAsk This Old House general contractor Tom Silva patches a chipped wood floor using a Dutchman and hand tools.\n\nClick here to SUBSCRIBE to the official This Old House YouTube channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=thisoldhouse\nTime: 4 hours\n\nCost: $50\n\nSkill Level: Moderate\n\nTools List for Patching a Wood Floor:\nDrill\nBlock plane\nHand saw\nUtility knife\nChisel\nForstner bit (optional)\n\nShopping List:\nPolyurethane glue\nWood glue\nRags\nFloorboard (same type as rest of floor)\nPrestain\nStain\nPainters tape\nPolyurethane\n\nSteps:\n1.

Limestone is basically calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The general source of lime is limestone and various other calcareous minerals, though shells, egg shells and coral are other sources of lime (for more information see video on Corporals Corner channel: https://youtu.be/tOhAfaFboNU or Skillcults channel: https://youtu.be/jOxaOTUGuKo). When heated above 840 degrees Celsius, the lime decomposes into calcium oxide (CaO) or Quicklime and releases carbon dioxide (CO2). When water is added to the quicklime it becomes calcium hydroxide Ca (OH)2 or lime putty. From here the calcium hydroxide can then be shaped into a form and allowed to set. Carbon dioxide enters the lime putty as it dries causing it to turn back into calcium carbonate. The new calcium carbonate has then set, remaining solid and water resistant. \nIn my local geography, calcareous rocks such as limestone are absent leading to a difficulty in acquiring the feed stock for lime making. However, I was still able to make lime by collecting the shells of large terrestrial snails that are native to the rainforest here. The unoccupied shells of these snails were gathered up and stored at the hut. Fire wood was gathered and packed neatly into the kiln. Importantly, the firewood was stacked on top of the grate rather than underneath it in the firebox as is the normal procedure for firing pottery. Using an ordinary updraft pottery kiln in this configuration allows it to reach much higher temperatures than would be possible during normal use. The wood was lit from above and the fire burned down towards the grate. Alternate layers of shells and wood were added on to this burning fuel bed. After adding the last layer of wood to act as a “lid” to prevent heat loss from above I left the kiln to finish on its own, unsupervised. The whole process took about an hour and a half.\nWhen the kiln had cooled down a few hours later, I took out the calcined shells. Not shown in the video was the fact that some shells got so hot, the dirt stuck to them turned into slag and fused to them, possibly with the lime acting a flux lowering its melting point. This extreme heat (+1200 c) should be avoided as the over burnt lime becomes “dead lime”, unable to slake in water. Most shells were still useable though. They were taken out of the kiln and had water added to them. An exothermic reaction then ensued. Heat was produced as the lime quicklime turned into slaked lime. The water heated up creating steam and the shells decomposed into a white paste. The paste was stirred and crushed pottery was added to it as an aggregate (sand is normally used for this, I just had a lot of old pot sherds lying about to dispose of). This lime mortar mixture was then formed into a block shape and left to dry. It took about a week and a half to set as we have had extremely humid, wet weather. The block was observed to have set demonstrating its properties.\nWhat I created is actually lime mortar, typically used for mortaring bricks and tiles together. It’s basically the ‘Glue’ that holds together the building blocks of masonry structures. From my research 20 kg of lime mortar is used on a 1 m square section of brick wall. 5 kg of lime to 15 kg of aggregate (sand, grog etc.) per a 1 m square section of bricks. The shells, though large, are not terribly abundant. A method for finding shells efficiently needs to be made before considering making lime mortar in this fashion. From my experience sand bars in a creek sometimes accumulate snail shells from higher up in the mountains. In these spots, water velocity decreases and shells in the water tend to drop out of the water column. Additionally lime may be partially replaced with ordinary wood ash in mortar without a corresponding decrease in strength. To conclude, making lime in a land without limestone is possible but can be problematic when trying to do so on a large scale.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ek3aeUhHaFY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ek3aeUhHaFY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ek3aeUhHaFY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ek3aeUhHaFY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ek3aeUhHaFY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Primitive Technology","categoryId":"22","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Primitive Technology: Lime","description":"At the old hut site (the new one being temporarily cut off by flooding) I made lime mortar from the shells of rainforest snails by firing them in a kiln, slaking them in water, mixing them into lime putty.

Includes terrific views of early types of jet engines and components including compressors, fans, combustion chambers, and so on.  At the 13 minute mark a variety of other uses for the turbine engine are shown including for power generation, fire fighting, marine propulsion, gas turbine locomotives, and more.  A prototype gas turbine car known as the Firebird is also shown at the 13:30 mark, probably at the Motorama, and at 15:40.  \n\nThe General Motors Firebird is a quartet of prototype cars designed by Harley Earl, and engineered by General Motors for the 1953, 1956 and 1959 Motorama auto shows. They were very much inspired by innovations in fighter aircraft design at the time. None of the designs were intended for production, but instead were to showcase the extremes in technology and design that General Motors was able to achieve. The cars were recently placed on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, and still make regular car show appearances.\n\nThe name \"Firebird\" was also used by the Pontiac division of General Motors for the line of pony cars, which has no direct relation to the concept cars.\n\nThe film includes footage of the prototype Boeing 707 aircraft in flight at the 15:30 mark.\n\nThe Wood River, Illinois facility of Shell Oil is also shown at the 15 minute mark, where jet fuels were exhaustively studied.  \n\nA gas turbine, also called a combustion turbine, is a type of internal combustion engine. It has an upstream rotating compressor coupled to a downstream turbine, and a combustion chamber in between.\n\nThe basic operation of the gas turbine is similar to that of the steam power plant except that air is used instead of water. Fresh atmospheric air flows through a compressor that brings it to higher pressure. Energy is then added by spraying fuel into the air and igniting it so the combustion generates a high-temperature flow. This high-temperature high-pressure gas enters a turbine, where it expands down to the exhaust pressure, producing a shaft work output in the process. The turbine shaft work is used to drive the compressor and other devices such as an electric generator that may be coupled to the shaft. The energy that is not used for shaft work comes out in the exhaust gases, so these have either a high temperature or a high velocity. The purpose of the gas turbine determines the design so that the most desirable energy form is maximized. Gas turbines are used to power aircraft, trains, ships, electrical generators, or even tanks.\n\nAirbreathing jet engines are gas turbines optimized to produce thrust from the exhaust gases, or from ducted fans connected to the gas turbines. Jet engines that produce thrust from the direct impulse of exhaust gases are often called turbojets, whereas those that generate thrust with the addition of a ducted fan are often called turbofans or (rarely) fan-jets.\n\nGas turbines are also used in many liquid propellant rockets, the gas turbines are used to power a turbopump to permit the use of lightweight, low pressure tanks, which saves considerable dry mass.\n\nTurboprop engines[edit]\nA turboprop engine is a type of turbine engine which drives an external aircraft propeller using a reduction gear. Turboprop engines are generally used on small subsonic aircraft, but some large military and civil aircraft, such as the Airbus A400M, Lockheed L-188 Electra and Tupolev Tu-95, have also used turboprop power.\n\nWe encourage viewers to add comments and, especially, to provide additional information about our videos by adding a comment!

We find out why.\n\nClick here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 \n\nSand is crucial for construction. Much of the global economy relies on it. We use 40 billion tonnes of it each year to build our cities and towns. But global reserves are running low.\n\nWHY IS SAND IN SHORT SUPPLY?\nIndustrial sand and gravel are the world’s most extracted materials. They are essential for the production of cement, concrete and asphalt. Global demand for sand has almost doubled since 2004.\n\nAnd as the world becomes more populated and urbanised, demand will continue to rise. 70% of the world’s annual supply of sand goes to Asia.\n\nChina used more cement between 2011 and 2013 than America did during the entire 20th century. However, the biggest importers are countries covered in sand – the Gulf States. \n\nSand from the Gulf region is too fine for use in construction.\nThe Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai was built using imported Australian sand.\n\nSand is produced from the weathering of rocks, corals and shells. Natural reserves took millions of years to build up. And now they are being depleted more quickly than they can be replenished.\n\nBut 40 billion tones are needed globally each year. Reserves are being depleted quicker than they can be replenished. \n\nExtracting sand takes its toll on the environment. Dredging rivers and seas for sand destroys natural habitats, pollutes waterways, and affects local fishing and farming industries.\n\nAnd our insatiable demand is set to rise. Global construction is forecast to grow 3.9%  each year until 2030.\n\nWhen current reserves are depleted, there will still be plenty of sand left in the world. But extracting it will be more difficult, more expensive, and more damaging to the environment.\n\nIn the future we might need to find a new material to build our concrete jungles.\n\nDaily Watch: mind-stretching short films throughout the working week.\n\nFor more from Economist Films visit: http://films.economist.com/ \nCheck out The Economist’s full video catalogue: http://econ.st/20IehQk \nLike The Economist on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheEconomist/ \nFollow The Economist on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theeconomist \nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/theeconomist/ \nFollow us on LINE: http://econ.st/1WXkOo6 \nFollow us on Medium: https://medium.com/@the_economist","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8J78ezpadFo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8J78ezpadFo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8J78ezpadFo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8J78ezpadFo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"The Economist","tags":["Sand","construction","environment","architecture","natural resources","why is sand in short supply","sand shortage","why sand is in short supply","sand supply","sand supply business","the economist","economist","economist films","economist magazine","economist video"],"categoryId":"25","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Why is sand in short supply? | The Economist","description":"The world uses 40 billion tonnes of sand each year to build cities and towns, but global reserves are running low.

Remove the bolt cap covers, nuts, and washers from the closet bolts on both sides.\n3. Carefully remove the toilet and place it on the drop cloth.\n4. Check the wax ring for deformities. This could be the cause of the wobbly toilet. The wax ring will need to be replaced in either case, so remove the old one with a putty knife.\n5. Since the toilet is already off, it’s always best practice to check the condition of the toilet flange and repair as necessary.\n6. Check the floor for level. If it’s out of level, it may be necessary to shim the toilet.\n7. Put new closet bolts on the toilet flange and replace the wax ring. \n8. Put the toilet back on the closet bolts. \n9. Put shims underneath the toilet until it is level.\n10. Add the cap base, the washer, and the nut to the closet bolts on both sides of the toilet. Alternate tightening each nut on both sides until the toilet is securely connected.\n11. Cut the excess off the closet bolts using the hacksaw. Cover the bolts with the caps. \n12.

The Tupolev TU-144 flew even faster than the Concorde and it carried more passengers. What happened to this aircraft and why have so few heard about it?\n\nGetting the TU-144 built before the Concorde (and therefore proving Soviet superiority to the world) was allegedly a high priority for the Soviets. The plane was developed under a tight schedule and relied on a few less advanced aviation technologies. The TU-144 suffered three known crashes, the most famous being at the 1973 Paris Air Show (there are conflicting theories on the cause of the 1973 crash).  In regular passenger service, the TU-144 proved unreliable. Only one flight a week was permitted on a single route between Moscow and Almaty, Kazakhstan. It is rumoured that Soviet leaders were nervous about the 144's airworthiness and ordered it's chief designer Alexei Tupolev to personally inspect every 144. \n\nSupersonic travel proved expensive and could only be offered as a 'premium' product in commercial airline travel. In west, the Concorde could be marketed as a luxury product to serve the wealthy and airfares could be sold at prices well beyond typical airfares.

The Tupolev TU-144 flew even faster than the Concorde and it carried more passengers. What happened to this aircraft and why have so few heard about it?\n\nGetting the TU-144 built before the Concorde (and therefore proving Soviet superiority to the world) was allegedly a high priority for the Soviets. The plane was developed under a tight schedule and relied on a few less advanced aviation technologies. The TU-144 suffered three known crashes, the most famous being at the 1973 Paris Air Show (there are conflicting theories on the cause of the 1973 crash).  In regular passenger service, the TU-144 proved unreliable. Only one flight a week was permitted on a single route between Moscow and Almaty, Kazakhstan. It is rumoured that Soviet leaders were nervous about the 144's airworthiness and ordered it's chief designer Alexei Tupolev to personally inspect every 144. \n\nSupersonic travel proved expensive and could only be offered as a 'premium' product in commercial airline travel. In west, the Concorde could be marketed as a luxury product to serve the wealthy and airfares could be sold at prices well beyond typical airfares. In the communist Soviet Union, where egalitarian principles demanded that displays of wealth or class be subdued, the TU-144 airfare had to be set similar to the typical Soviet airfare. This meant that the 144 had to be operated at a loss for Aeroflot, and Aeroflot couldn't wait to stop flying it.\n\nThe TU-144 was removed from regular passenger service less than a year after it began (although cargo service was offered for a couple more years).

This video summaries all the of the mind blowing facts about the gravitational waves and describes LIGO, the incredibly sensitive telescope that detected them.\n\nIf you would like to buy a poster you can get one here http://www.redbubble.com/people/dominicwalliman/works/24649310-gravitational-wave-astronomy?asc=u&p=poster&rel=carousel\n\nErrata and clarifications.\n\nI endeavour to be as accurate as possible in my videos, but I am human and definitely don’t know everything, so there are sometimes mistakes. Also, because my videos are summaries of some quite complex science, I make simplifications. Some of these are intentional because I don’t have time to go into full detail, but sometimes they are unintentional and here is where I clear them up.\n\n1. I got the month of the original detection wrong! It was September 2015, not November 2015. Silly me, my apologies.\n2. “1.3 billion years ago, 1.3 billion light years away” This is incorrect and an oversight on my part. I completely forgot to take into account the expansion of the Universe. The resulting black hole is 1.3 billion light years from us today, but was closer to us when the collision happened, which means that it happened less than 1.3 billion years ago. I tried to work out exactly when but was stumped because I couldn’t find the function for the acceleration of the expansion of the universe. The redshift of the signal from the black holes was about 10%, so I thought the collision was 10% closer in time than 1.3 billion years i.e. 1.18 billion years, but I think it might be a bit more complicated than that. \n3. LIGO schematic animation. I made a couple of silly errors here. The first circular mirror that the laser hits should be 90º to the way I oriented it: half the laser light is transmitted and half reflected, each one going up a different arm.\n4. LIGO schematic animation. When the laser bounced back and forth it should bounce between the two suspended mirrors and not go all the way back to the diagonal mirror.\n5. VIRGO is near Pisa, not at Trento as I drew on the map. I said the right thing but drew the wrong thing. My apologies.\n6. ‘A second even more powerful collision.” Wrong again! The second collision was less powerful and the signal was more buried in the noise.\n\nI’m not happy with the number of flat out mistakes I made on this one! I will try better in the future. I blame it on the Christmas spirits.\n\nIf you would like to find out more about gravitational waves and the detection here are the original papers and some very informative links.\n\nMain LIGO scientific paper: http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102\nSupplementary LIGO paper: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8205/818/2/L22\n\nArticles:\nhttp://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2016/feb/11/ligo-detects-first-ever-gravitational-waves-from-two-merging-black-holes\nhttp://www.nature.com/news/the-black-hole-collision-that-reshaped-physics-1.19612\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/black-hole-collision-energy-50-times-universe-2016-2\nhttp://www.space.com/33176-gravitational-waves-from-second-black-hole-collision.html\nhttp://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-GW150914/index.php\nhttp://www.nature.com/news/gravitational-waves-6-cosmic-questions-they-can-tackle-1.19337\nhttp://www.nature.com/news/the-black-hole-collision-that-reshaped-physics-1.19612\nWhat they sound like:\nhttp://www.vox.com/2016/6/15/11948618/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-hole-sound\n\nAlso, if you enjoyed this video, you will probably like my science books, available in all good books shops around the work and is printed in 16 languages.

It takes your weight (sorry my fellow Americans, everyone else is on the metric system) in kilograms divides and divides it by height in meters squared. And from this you get a number that represent your total body mass relative to your height and weight. The ranges go from underweight to obese, and one decimal point can tip you in either direction. BMI has been used to study obesity in large populations, and for the most part it’s okay for those types of studies.

I got the Oxidising Agent and the Reducing Agent the wrong way around! Sodium is the Reducing agent and Chlorine is the Oxidising agent. My confusion was that when a sodium atom looses an electron it becomes oxidised, so in my simple brain, I called it the oxidising agent. That is wrong because the agent that oxidises the sodium is the chlorine atom and so the labels are the wrong way around. Doh!\n2. I drew the hydrogen H2 molecule with a double bond but it should be a single bond because they are bonded with a single covalent bond.\n3. Where I have drawn carbon dioxide, the carbon should have a double bond to each of the oxygens.\n4. Apparently Feynman diagrams are not that useful for theoretical chemistry, so perhaps that wasn't the best choice for the illustration. The feedback in the comments from a real theoretical chemist is \"All we deal with is shuffling around electrons, but many many many electrons, so a Feynman diagram would need to be huge but at the same time would be very very repetitive.\"\n5. In analytical chemistry, I should have called it distillation rather than precipitation.\n6. My definition of organic chemistry being about ‘life’ is not very good. I should have said that organic chemistry looks at compounds that contain carbon. But there are some compounds in inorganic chemistry that also contain carbon, like carbon dioxide so I guess I'd also have to state that inorganic chemistry is almost everything else.\n7. I said that fuels are inorganic chemistry which is misleading when I drew a car next to it. My understanding is that there are inorganic fuels that don't contain carbon, but obviously all the fuels we are familiar with are organic. I thought a picture of a car would tie a few things together elegantly, but it ended up giving the wrong impression. That’s okay, I’m still learning! :D\n8. In inorganic chemistry, I should have stated that all natural minerals fall under inorganic chemistry so as not to be misleading, otherwise you might go way thinking that only man-made substances fall under inorganic chemistry which is not true. I said that 'a lot of the inorganic compounds that are studied are man-made' meaning that the cutting edge of research is mostly man-made substances.\n9. Apparently water is not the most inflammable substance. I thought it was so that is interesting.\n10.

In the bonding section, hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces are technically inter molecular forces.\n\nHere are some of the references I used for this video if you’d like to dig a little deeper\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_chemistry\nhttps://www.uwlax.edu/chemistry-and-biochemistry/student-resources/different-types-of-chemistry/\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry\nhttps://www.cancerquest.org/cancer-biology/biological-building-blocks\nEarly smelting:\nhttp://ispatguru.com/evolution-of-blast-furnace-iron-making/\nCategorisation of reactions\nhttp://www2.ucdsb.on.ca/tiss/stretton/chem1/stoich2.html\nAnd The Great Courses Plus have lots of great videos: http://ow.ly/crsQ30beNOZ\n‘The Great Courses Plus is currently available to watch through a web browser to almost anyone in the world and optimized for the US market.

I’ll be doing some testing to see if this is actually true in a later video. \n\nOur first step in changing out the brakes is to loosen the wheel lug nuts. Next, we need to lift the wheels off the ground. Be sure to locate the proper jacking points in your owners manual before lifting the car. With the car raised, we can remove the wheels and access the brakes.Starting at the front, first we need to remove the brake caliper to get access to the rotor. To remove the caliper piston & brake pads, there are two bolts on the backside of the caliper. Use a wrench to hold the caliper pin in place, while using a socket wrench to remove the bolts. After removing these two bolts, you can pull the caliper free - set it aside and be sure not to let it hang from the brake line. You can now also remove the two brake pads.\n\nNext, we’ll remove the caliper bracket. There are two screws to remove, and then it can be pulled free. With complete access, now we can start removing the brake rotor. Usually there are two screws which hold it in, which if they’re old will likely be rusted at this point. Using a screwdriver and a mallet or hammer, give the rusted screws several hammer taps to help disturb the rust. Then, using a screwdriver, or perhaps an impact wrench if needed, remove the two screws. If nothing seems to get them to budge, you can simply drill out the screws so they’re no longer fastening the rotor.\n\nAt this point, the rotor is free to remove, but it’s likely that rust will hold it in place. There are two bolt holes to break it from the rust. Using the bolts from the caliper, screw them into the rotor, and slowly tighten each bolt, alternating back and forth, until the rotor finally breaks away.\n\nBefore installing the new rotor, spray both sides with brake cleaner to remove any protective oil or residue that may be left on the surface. On the hub where the brake rotor rests, rust can build up, so I’m using a wire brush on a drill bit to remove some of the rust and clean up the hub a bit. Slide the new rotor in place, aligning the orientation with the screw holes. You can use a single lug nut to hold the rotor in place while you assemble the brake caliper.\n\nNext we’ll put the brake caliper bracket back in place using the two bolts. Honda’s torque spec for these bolts is 79.6 lb-ft. (108 N-m). With the new brake pads, Honda recommends applying Molykote M77 or Daikalub 528D to the back and sides of the backing plate, as well as on the back of the shims. If your pads came with new hardware, replace the clips in caliper bracket, and then slide the brake pads in place. Make sure not to get any grease on the rotors or pad face.\n\nNow we need to push the piston back into the caliper. Before doing so, it’s a good idea to wipe down the surface & exposed sides of the piston. Then place the old brake pad against the piston, and using a brake pad piston compressor, press the piston back into place. It shouldn’t require much effort, and once the effort gets high, the piston is likely flush with the caliper and you can stop. I bought this tool for $8 from Harbor Freight, and it works just fine.\n\nNext, be sure the brake caliper pins are lubricated and can rotate freely. It’s a good idea to inspect these and apply grease as necessary. Slide the caliper over the brake pads, and torque down the two bolts to 24 lb-ft (32 N-m). Now we can put the wheel back on, and tighten down the lug nuts. Because the car is lifted, we’ll need to wait until it’s lowered again to apply the correct torque. \n\nEngineering Explained is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com. \n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below!\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained\nOfficial Website: http://www.howdoesacarwork.com\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/jasonfenske13\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained\nCar Throttle: https://www.carthrottle.com/user/engineeringexplained\nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA\n\nNEW VIDEO EVERY WEDNESDAY!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ml4WyK_piRM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ml4WyK_piRM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ml4WyK_piRM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ml4WyK_piRM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ml4WyK_piRM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Engineering Explained","tags":["brake pads","brake rotors","honda","s2000","replace brakes","how to brakes","brake testing","brembo","caliper","4 piston","6 piston","directional brake rotors","performance rotors","honda diy","diy","how to","chrisfix","engineering explained","s2k","quickjack","bendpak"],"categoryId":"2","liveBroadcastContent":"none","defaultLanguage":"en","localized":{"title":"How To Replace Brake Pads And Rotors (Front & Rear)","description":"How To Install Brake Pads & Rotors On A Honda S2000\nQuickJack -  https://www.quickjack.com/\nSubscribe for new videos every Wednesday! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7\n\nProducts Used:\nQuickJack -  http://amzn.to/2sfGmXV (5,000 lb in video)\nBrake Piston Tool - http://amzn.to/2tWIFMv\nSilicon Paste For Brake Pins - http://amzn.to/2tWbHvG\nMolykote M77 - http://amzn.to/2sZgNri\nAluminum Anti-Sieze - http://amzn.to/2sg4Ccj\nCopper Anti-Sieze - http://amzn.to/2sfTxI8\nBrake Pads - http://bit.ly/2tn0WFO\nFront Brake Rotors - http://bit.ly/2sfprEZ\nRear Brake Rotors - http://amzn.to/2sZS9Xu\n\nI’ve picked out some rotors with directional vanes, rather than straight vanes, which supposedly offer better cooling as they help pump air through the brakes, which leads to less brake fade.

That’s essentially what’s happened to thousands of New York City taxi drivers.\n\nEach NYC yellow taxi needs a medallion, which is like a license, in order to operate legally. Drivers can lease or buy them. New York City and state cap the total number of medallions, and there are less than 14,000 of them available today.\n\nFor decades, that scarcity made medallions a seemingly safe investment.

That’s essentially what’s happened to thousands of New York City taxi drivers.\n\nEach NYC yellow taxi needs a medallion, which is like a license, in order to operate legally. Drivers can lease or buy them. New York City and state cap the total number of medallions, and there are less than 14,000 of them available today.\n\nFor decades, that scarcity made medallions a seemingly safe investment. Cab drivers who saved up a 10 percent downpayment could finance a medallion through a credit union.

Natural draft is the flow of air through a furnace due to rising hot air. The hot gasses in the fuel bed are more buoyant than the cold air outside the furnace causing them to rise. Fresh combustion air then enters the base of the furnace to replace the rising combustion gasses, keeping the fuel bed burning. This effect increases with: 1. the average temperature of the fuel bed relative to the outside air and 2. The height of the furnace. Two other important factors are the size of the tuyere (air entry pipe) and lump size of the fuel bed as these effect the resistance to airflow through the furnace. The furnace was tested with wood fuel and some ore was melted but produced no iron. High temperature were indeed produced (probably about 1200 c). These types of furnaces were once used for smelting copper and iron ores in around the world in ancient times, usually using charcoal as a fuel and in some cases wood too.\nI designed the furnace using a formula from the book “The mastery and uses of fire in antiquity” by J.E. Rehder. It was designed to have a space velocity (air speed within the furnace) of 6 m per minute which is recommended for iron smelting. The furnace was 175 cm in total height but with a height of only 150 cm above the tuyere. The height between the air entry and the top of the furnace is what determines the strength of the draft, the space beneath the air entry is not included in the formula. The internal furnace diameter was 25 cm. The walls were about 12.5 cm thick at the base but got thinner with height. The tuyere (air entry pipe) was 7.5 cm internal diameter and about 20 cm long. The tuyere was placed into an opening in the base of the furnace and sealed with mud. The whole thing took about a week to make due to the slow drying time that was assisted by keeping a fire burning in side it. The furnace was designed to use charcoal (which in this case should be 2.5 cm diameter lumps) but I used wood to test it instead as it was easier to acquire. To test its melting ability, bog ore was found further down the creek and roasted. The roasted ore was then crushed and stored in a pot. \nThe furnace was filled with wood and lit from the top. The fire burnt down the furnace producing charcoal. On reaching the tuyere the fire then started burning the charcoal. Wood was also continually added from the top along with a few small handfuls of the roasted bog ore (not shown in the video). The temperature of hot objects can be visually estimated from their incandescence.  After about an hour, the light coming out of the tuyere was high yellow to white hot indicating a temperature of at about 1200 c. Colour temperature charts vary but white hot is usually given to be at least 1200 c, examples of these charts can be found on the internet for reference. It was uncomfortable to stare into the tuyere and doing so left an after image when looking away, indicating the strength of its brightness. After about an hour and a half the furnace was left to burn out. When opened the next day the tuyere was covered in slag with bits of slag found on the furnace floor also. \nThis experiment shows that high temperatures can be achieved without the use of bellows or charcoal, which might significantly reduce labour in the production of iron. The furnace was technically easy to build as it was a simple vertical cylinder. When running, the wood added to the top of the furnace converts to charcoal in the upper part of the stack and is consumed in the lower part. The ore I used was new to me, normally I use iron bacteria as an ore. This new ore produced no metallic iron so I’m inclined to use iron bacteria in future. Natural draft furnaces were once used to smelt copper and iron ores in the past, usually with charcoal fuel and less frequently with wood. The main benefit of these furnaces seems to have been the reduction in labour they provide and simplified infrastructure (fewer workers and no bellows required during operation).","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u7wAJTGl2gc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u7wAJTGl2gc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u7wAJTGl2gc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u7wAJTGl2gc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u7wAJTGl2gc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Primitive Technology","categoryId":"22","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Primitive Technology: Natural Draft Furnace","description":"I built a natural draft furnace to test ideas about how hot a furnace could get without the use of bellows.

And perhaps no one knows this better than would-be African migrants to the European Union. In North Africa, on the border of Morocco, there's a Spanish town called Melilla. It's technically Europe.\n\nSo undocumented migrants and refugees, asylum seekers, wait in limbo for a chance to scale the fence and apply for asylum in Europe. It's the first of many, many hurdles.

It passed without a single vote from Democrats in the House or the Senate, and it’s a huge windfall for the richest Americans, including President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Republicans didn’t just want any new tax law, they wanted to reform the tax code. To give the richest Americans a big tax cut while still funding the government’s essential functions, like building roads and flying fighter jets, the GOP needed to find tax revenue somewhere else.

I will run 1km further every week) for qualitative systems—like writing every morning with no word target, or running in a new environment each week—that nourish you psychologically, and are independently rewarding each time you do them.

This is the way a goal works: You say to yourself, “When I achieve (whatever the thing is), that's how I'll know I'll have succeeded, and I'm going to do everything I can to get to that point as quickly as possible.” What that means is you exist in a failure state for a long time until you reach that goal, if it's a long-range goal. And so as you evaluate your process all you get is the negative feedback of not having achieved that goal. Perhaps as you move closer to it there's some positive feedback, but if the goal is really the end state that you're seeking out, there's a lot of failure before you get there. And now here's the thing: when you do get there it's a massive anti-climax.\n\nSo there are people who achieve the highest highs; people who achieve the highest highs in athletics, in business, and if you talk to them and you ask them to describe what it's like to reach their goals they say things like, “I got there and it was an incredible anti-climax. The minute I got there I had to start something new, I had to find a new goal.” And that's partly because there's something really unsatisfying about the moment of reaching the goal. Unless it has its own benefits that come from reaching the goal, if it's just a sort of signpost; that doesn't do much for us, it doesn't nourish us psychologically. And what that ends up meaning is that we have to try to find something new.\n\nSo really if you look at life as a series of goals, which for many of us it is, it's a period of being unsuccessful in achieving the goal, then hitting the goal, then feeling like you haven't really got much from that goal, going to the next one—and it's a sort of series of escalating goals.\nA really good example of this is, say, smart watches or Fitbits or exercise watches. People, when they get those watches, a lot of them hit on the number 10,000. “I want to walk 10,000 steps.” When you do that, the thing will beep; you'll feel pretty good about it for a minute but then that feels a little hollow and the goal escalates over time. People will describe going from 10 to 11 to 12 to 14,000 steps to the point where they're moving through injuries, through stress-related injuries, because the goal is there; they respond to the goal more than they do to their internal cues, and basically there's something really unfulfilling about that.\n\nThe reason the goal keeps escalating and becoming more and more intense is because when they achieve the goal they don't actually get anything for that achievement, and so goals, generally I think, are in many ways broken processes.\n\nI think part of the problem with goals is that they don't tell you how to get to where you're going. A better thing to do is to use a system. So the idea behind a system rather than a goal is that a system is saying things like, “I’m a writer, my goal is to finish writing this book but I'm not going to think about it in that way. Eventually I'll have 100,000 words, but my system will be that for an hour every morning I will sit in front of my computer screen and I will type. It doesn't matter what that looks like. I'm not going to evaluate the number of words. I'm not going to set some benchmark, some artificial number or benchmark that I should reach, what I'm going to do is just say, 'Here's my system: an hour a day in front of the screen. I'll do what I can—bam.'”","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x44zEK39GOM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x44zEK39GOM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x44zEK39GOM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x44zEK39GOM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x44zEK39GOM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Big Think","tags":["Big Think","BigThink","BigThink.com","Education","Educational","Lifelong Learning","EDU","adam alter","psychology","goal setting","systems","fitbit","process","10000 steps"],"categoryId":"27","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Goal Setting Is a Hamster Wheel.

In 2005, it set a record for most cars unloaded from a ship in Canada. Kind of a weird record, but hey, who are we to judge? \n\nA year later, Cougar Ace was carrying 4,812 brand new cars, about 97 % being Mazdas. In total, the cargo was valued at $117 Million… Well during an exchange of ballast water, the stuff that keeps boats balanced and stable, the Cougar Ace tipped 60 degrees to port . Which means the ship looked like - This.\n\nWith some luck, Titan Salvage were able to tug the ship to Unalaska Island, where it was finally “righted”, meaning the ship was no longer tilted, then it was towed to Portland, Oregon for inspections and repair.\n\nThis incident was quite the nightmare for Mazda. At first, they said the cars would be not be sold as brand new, but after testing the safety of the cars, the company decided to scrap every...single...one..\n\n6.MV Baltic Ace | Netherlands\n\n5.MV Rena | New Zealand\n\nThe MV Rena was a container ship with a capacity for 3,351 containers of whatever you want to transfer globally. \n\nWith an engine that had a max output of 29,497 horse power, this 38,000 ton, 106ft(32m) long ship was built in  1990 and served multiple companies throughout the years.\n\nIn October 2011, the MV Rena ran aground on the Astrolabe reef near the Bay of Plenty in New Zealand. This was already very bad for the local environment and reef, but things got even worse when the Rena started leaking oil.

In 2005, it set a record for most cars unloaded from a ship in Canada. Kind of a weird record, but hey, who are we to judge? \n\nA year later, Cougar Ace was carrying 4,812 brand new cars, about 97 % being Mazdas. In total, the cargo was valued at $117 Million… Well during an exchange of ballast water, the stuff that keeps boats balanced and stable, the Cougar Ace tipped 60 degrees to port . Which means the ship looked like - This.\n\nWith some luck, Titan Salvage were able to tug the ship to Unalaska Island, where it was finally “righted”, meaning the ship was no longer tilted, then it was towed to Portland, Oregon for inspections and repair.\n\nThis incident was quite the nightmare for Mazda. At first, they said the cars would be not be sold as brand new, but after testing the safety of the cars, the company decided to scrap every...single...one..\n\n6.MV Baltic Ace | Netherlands\n\n5.MV Rena | New Zealand\n\nThe MV Rena was a container ship with a capacity for 3,351 containers of whatever you want to transfer globally. \n\nWith an engine that had a max output of 29,497 horse power, this 38,000 ton, 106ft(32m) long ship was built in  1990 and served multiple companies throughout the years.\n\nIn October 2011, the MV Rena ran aground on the Astrolabe reef near the Bay of Plenty in New Zealand. This was already very bad for the local environment and reef, but things got even worse when the Rena started leaking oil. Because of bad weather, the crew of 20 was evacuated, when the ship started shifting.\n\nA few days later, the oil spill was declared the worst maritime environmental disaster of New Zealand, and people were rightly pissed.\n\nA few days later, the ship was sitting at a 20 degree tilt, and 88 of the cargo containers fell into the sea.\n\nIn January 2012, the ship finally succumbed to the sea and broke in 2.

The diseases they transmit kill hundreds of thousands of people each year. \n \n---+ How many people get malaria each year?\nIn 2015, malaria, the deadliest mosquito-borne disease, killed roughly 635,000 people, mostly children under the age of five and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. \n\n---+ What diseases do mosquitoes transmit?\nMalaria, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile and Zika are some of the diseases that mosquitoes transmit. \n\nDengue fever, transmitted Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, is estimated to make almost 400 million people sick with jabbing joint pain each year. \n\nScientists also believe that Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the main culprit for more than 350 confirmed cases of congenital malformations associated with the Zika virus in the northeastern Brazilian state of Pernambuco. Since last October, an unusually high number of babies have been born there with small heads and a host of health problems like convulsions, suspected of being caused by a Zika virus infection early in their mother’s pregnancy.\n\n---+ What diseases can I get from mosquitoes in the United States?\nWest Nile virus is the most important of several mosquito-transmitted viruses now native to the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control.\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThe Bombardier Beetle And Its Crazy Chemical Cannon\nhttps://youtu.be/BWwgLS5tK80\n\n--- See also this new Zika video from PBS Digital Studios:\n\nShould You Be Worried About Zika? | It's Okay to Be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ9S_3RFBgc\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

As overdose totals rise, grandparents and other relative caregivers are stepping in to raise the children of addicted parents. Unlike foster care, \"kinship care\" has unique requirements that are often not recognized in a child welfare system that was designed to support non-relative foster parents. As grandparents struggle to raise children on their own, they often don't realize that there are support options available until they are told by a kinship navigator or other social service coordinator. Kinship navigators fill the void created by the lack of a dedicated social services organization for kinship families. As navigators, they help inform and connect kinship caregivers to the patchwork of various programs, grants, and other services (legal, financial, health) that they are eligible to receive.

As overdose totals rise, grandparents and other relative caregivers are stepping in to raise the children of addicted parents. Unlike foster care, \"kinship care\" has unique requirements that are often not recognized in a child welfare system that was designed to support non-relative foster parents. As grandparents struggle to raise children on their own, they often don't realize that there are support options available until they are told by a kinship navigator or other social service coordinator. Kinship navigators fill the void created by the lack of a dedicated social services organization for kinship families. As navigators, they help inform and connect kinship caregivers to the patchwork of various programs, grants, and other services (legal, financial, health) that they are eligible to receive. Often, however, grandparents are unaware of their existence and seek other ways to support themselves -- sometimes by attending therapy groups with other relative caregivers that are raising children of the opioid epidemic.

It can also be used for structural applications; hollow pipe is far stiffer per unit weight than solid members.\n\nIn common usage the words pipe and tube are usually interchangeable, but in industry and engineering, the terms are uniquely defined. Depending on the applicable standard to which it is manufactured, pipe is generally specified by a nominal diameter with a constant outside diameter (OD) and a schedule that defines the thickness. Tube is most often specified by the OD and wall thickness, but may be specified by any two of OD, inside diameter (ID), and wall thickness. Pipe is generally manufactured to one of several international and national industrial standards.[1] While similar standards exist for specific industry application tubing, tube is often made to custom sizes and a broader range of diameters and tolerances. Many industrial and government standards exist for the production of pipe and tubing. The term \"tube\" is also commonly applied to non-cylindrical sections, i.e., square or rectangular tubing. In general, \"pipe\" is the more common term in most of the world, whereas \"tube\" is more widely used in the United States.\n\nBoth \"pipe\" and \"tube\" imply a level of rigidity and permanence, whereas a hose (or hosepipe) is usually portable and flexible. Pipe assemblies are almost always constructed with the use of fittings such as elbows, tees, and so on, while tube may be formed or bent into custom configurations. For materials that are inflexible, cannot be formed, or where construction is governed by codes or standards, tube assemblies are also constructed with the use of tube fittings...\n\nThere are three processes for metallic pipe manufacture. Centrifugal casting of hot alloyed metal is one of the most prominent process. Ductile iron pipes are generally manufactured in such a fashion. Seamless (SMLS) pipe is formed by drawing a solid billet over a piercing rod to create the hollow shell. As the manufacturing process does not include any welding, seamless pipes are perceived to be stronger and more reliable...\n\nAdvances since the 1970s in materials, process control, and non-destructive testing, allow correctly specified welded pipe to replace seamless in many applications. Welded pipe is formed by rolling plate and welding the seam (usually by Electric resistance welding (\"ERW\"), or Electric Fusion Welding (\"EFW\")). The weld flash can be removed from both inner and outer surfaces using a scarfing blade. The weld zone can also be heat-treated to make the seam less visible. Welded pipe often have tighter dimensional tolerances than the seamless type, and can be cheaper to manufacture...\n\nERW pipes are manufactured from the longitudinal welding of steel. The welding process for ERW pipes is continuous, as opposed to welding of distinct sections at intervals. ERW process uses steel coil as feedstock.\n\nThe High Frequency Induction Technology (HFI) welding process is used for manufacturing ERW pipes.

The ability to move single atoms — the smallest particles of any element in the universe — is crucial to IBM's research in the field of atomic memory. But even nanophysicists need to have a little fun.

We all know how quickly the cost of eating out adds up, and when you break down the finances, a simple investment in groceries once or twice a week can save you a ton of money in the long run. This is why I'm challenging all of you to the #packlunchpact  - It’s time to switch up your daily routine and get the incredible rewards of cooking your homemade food and bringing it with you to work, school, or even when you just leave the house for a few hours. It’s pretty rare that I ever leave the house these days without bringing some type of homemade treat because when I pack my own food to go, not only do I save a ton of money, but the reward of eating my homemade yummy food made with love, trumps anything I would get in a store! It can be a little strange at first, but the more you do it, the more it become second nature and part of your everyday lifestyle.\n\nPrizes - 3 people who complete the challenge and follow the guidelines below will win a private consultation video call with me on anything food related. This could be a business idea, a menu your're working on, a recipe you're struggling with or anything else you can think of. Those same 3 people will also win free admission into my sourdough bread making masters class coming out very soon. \n\nGuidelines - \n1. starting this Monday you must pack at least 1 homemade food item for 5 days straight, this could be anything from a full packed lunch, a simple smoothie, or even a homemade snack. \n2.

We all know how quickly the cost of eating out adds up, and when you break down the finances, a simple investment in groceries once or twice a week can save you a ton of money in the long run. This is why I'm challenging all of you to the #packlunchpact  - It’s time to switch up your daily routine and get the incredible rewards of cooking your homemade food and bringing it with you to work, school, or even when you just leave the house for a few hours. It’s pretty rare that I ever leave the house these days without bringing some type of homemade treat because when I pack my own food to go, not only do I save a ton of money, but the reward of eating my homemade yummy food made with love, trumps anything I would get in a store! It can be a little strange at first, but the more you do it, the more it become second nature and part of your everyday lifestyle.\n\nPrizes - 3 people who complete the challenge and follow the guidelines below will win a private consultation video call with me on anything food related. This could be a business idea, a menu your're working on, a recipe you're struggling with or anything else you can think of. Those same 3 people will also win free admission into my sourdough bread making masters class coming out very soon. \n\nGuidelines - \n1. starting this Monday you must pack at least 1 homemade food item for 5 days straight, this could be anything from a full packed lunch, a simple smoothie, or even a homemade snack. \n2.

Meet the two scientists who invented it at the same time in two different places.\n\nJet engines date back to the invention of the aeolipile before the first century AD. This device directed steam power through two nozzles to cause a sphere to spin rapidly on its axis. So far as is known, it did not supply mechanical power and the potential practical applications of this invention did not receive recognition. Instead, it was seen as a curiosity.\n\nJet propulsion only gained practical applications with the invention of the gunpowder-powered rocket by the Chinese in the 13th century as a type of firework, and gradually progressed to propel formidable weaponry. However, although very powerful, at reasonable flight speeds rockets are very inefficient and so jet propulsion technology stalled for hundreds of years.\n\nIn common parlance, the term jet engine loosely refers to an internal combustion airbreathing jet engine. These typically feature a rotating air compressor powered by a turbine, with the leftover power providing thrust via a propelling nozzle — this process is known as the Brayton thermodynamic cycle. Jet aircraft use such engines for long-distance travel. Early jet aircraft used turbojet engines which were relatively inefficient for subsonic flight. Modern subsonic jet aircraft usually use more complex high-bypass turbofan engines.

Limestone is basically calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The general source of lime is limestone and various other calcareous minerals, though shells, egg shells and coral are other sources of lime (for more information see video on Corporals Corner channel: https://youtu.be/tOhAfaFboNU or Skillcults channel: https://youtu.be/jOxaOTUGuKo). When heated above 840 degrees Celsius, the lime decomposes into calcium oxide (CaO) or Quicklime and releases carbon dioxide (CO2). When water is added to the quicklime it becomes calcium hydroxide Ca (OH)2 or lime putty. From here the calcium hydroxide can then be shaped into a form and allowed to set. Carbon dioxide enters the lime putty as it dries causing it to turn back into calcium carbonate. The new calcium carbonate has then set, remaining solid and water resistant. \nIn my local geography, calcareous rocks such as limestone are absent leading to a difficulty in acquiring the feed stock for lime making. However, I was still able to make lime by collecting the shells of large terrestrial snails that are native to the rainforest here. The unoccupied shells of these snails were gathered up and stored at the hut. Fire wood was gathered and packed neatly into the kiln. Importantly, the firewood was stacked on top of the grate rather than underneath it in the firebox as is the normal procedure for firing pottery. Using an ordinary updraft pottery kiln in this configuration allows it to reach much higher temperatures than would be possible during normal use. The wood was lit from above and the fire burned down towards the grate. Alternate layers of shells and wood were added on to this burning fuel bed. After adding the last layer of wood to act as a “lid” to prevent heat loss from above I left the kiln to finish on its own, unsupervised. The whole process took about an hour and a half.\nWhen the kiln had cooled down a few hours later, I took out the calcined shells. Not shown in the video was the fact that some shells got so hot, the dirt stuck to them turned into slag and fused to them, possibly with the lime acting a flux lowering its melting point. This extreme heat (+1200 c) should be avoided as the over burnt lime becomes “dead lime”, unable to slake in water. Most shells were still useable though. They were taken out of the kiln and had water added to them. An exothermic reaction then ensued. Heat was produced as the lime quicklime turned into slaked lime. The water heated up creating steam and the shells decomposed into a white paste. The paste was stirred and crushed pottery was added to it as an aggregate (sand is normally used for this, I just had a lot of old pot sherds lying about to dispose of). This lime mortar mixture was then formed into a block shape and left to dry. It took about a week and a half to set as we have had extremely humid, wet weather. The block was observed to have set demonstrating its properties.\nWhat I created is actually lime mortar, typically used for mortaring bricks and tiles together. It’s basically the ‘Glue’ that holds together the building blocks of masonry structures. From my research 20 kg of lime mortar is used on a 1 m square section of brick wall. 5 kg of lime to 15 kg of aggregate (sand, grog etc.) per a 1 m square section of bricks. The shells, though large, are not terribly abundant. A method for finding shells efficiently needs to be made before considering making lime mortar in this fashion. From my experience sand bars in a creek sometimes accumulate snail shells from higher up in the mountains. In these spots, water velocity decreases and shells in the water tend to drop out of the water column. Additionally lime may be partially replaced with ordinary wood ash in mortar without a corresponding decrease in strength. To conclude, making lime in a land without limestone is possible but can be problematic when trying to do so on a large scale.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ek3aeUhHaFY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ek3aeUhHaFY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ek3aeUhHaFY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ek3aeUhHaFY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ek3aeUhHaFY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Primitive Technology","categoryId":"22","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Primitive Technology: Lime","description":"At the old hut site (the new one being temporarily cut off by flooding) I made lime mortar from the shells of rainforest snails by firing them in a kiln, slaking them in water, mixing them into lime putty.

The ultimate wake up early motivation.\n\nFirst you need to know how much sleep you need to not feel like shit when you wake up, and know that you can actually get too much sleep and feel lazy for the rest of the day. The perfect amount of sleep is most often between 5-9 hours and I challenge you to set the alarm earlier than you normally would to sleep less than usual just to evaluate how you feel. \n\nOptimize your environment\n\nEliminate sources of light and try to block it all out. Shove the tv out if you have one in your bedroom and instead pick up a book to read. Preferably fiction rather than business or self-help as that will trigger your brain and you’ll get all sorts of cool ideas that will hinder you from falling asleep. \nThere are a lot of techniques you can use to fall asleep faster and wake up fresh, and I’ve made a video about 6 uncommon tips that will definitely speed this process up.\nBut some more common things or tools you can use that will optimize your sleeping environment is white noise machines. It’s a tool that reduces the distracting effect of outsides noises for a more relaxing environment. It’s almost like a heavenly fan without the breeze, just the sound. \nAnd this might sound awful to you but it’s highly effective for falling asleep because you won’t notice those weird random noises that you otherwise would be convinced is the ring girl coming for you.\nAnother tool to wake up fresh is to use wake up light alarm clocks. It will wake you up by first turning on the a light which will increase in brightness, and eventually go over to sounds. Some models have nature sounds and others just normal beeping sounds. It’s a pretty neat way to wake up and takes away that choking beep normal alarms give you.\n\n\nDon’t snooze\n\nDon’t snooze. Don’t ever hit that snooze button man, c'mon you know better than that. I don’t have to explain this much more but just knock fudge out of that alarm clock and let it know who’s the boss, then you want to count from 5 backwards to zero, like you’re taking of with a rocket. Once you reach 0 you’re up and away. It really is that simple and you’ll be up within 10 seconds of the alarm going off. \n\nMe personally, I just go full savage and place my alarm clock on the other side of the room or in the kitchen with full volume. \n\nHave a reason\n\nThe number one thing for making this habit stick is that you should want to get up, just like you wanted to get up for christmas as a kid. You can’t convince yourself to wake up early just because, there has to be a reason for you waking up.\n\nOne thing that get’s me to follow any habit is the checklist manifesto.

The ultimate wake up early motivation.\n\nFirst you need to know how much sleep you need to not feel like shit when you wake up, and know that you can actually get too much sleep and feel lazy for the rest of the day. The perfect amount of sleep is most often between 5-9 hours and I challenge you to set the alarm earlier than you normally would to sleep less than usual just to evaluate how you feel. \n\nOptimize your environment\n\nEliminate sources of light and try to block it all out. Shove the tv out if you have one in your bedroom and instead pick up a book to read. Preferably fiction rather than business or self-help as that will trigger your brain and you’ll get all sorts of cool ideas that will hinder you from falling asleep. \nThere are a lot of techniques you can use to fall asleep faster and wake up fresh, and I’ve made a video about 6 uncommon tips that will definitely speed this process up.\nBut some more common things or tools you can use that will optimize your sleeping environment is white noise machines. It’s a tool that reduces the distracting effect of outsides noises for a more relaxing environment. It’s almost like a heavenly fan without the breeze, just the sound. \nAnd this might sound awful to you but it’s highly effective for falling asleep because you won’t notice those weird random noises that you otherwise would be convinced is the ring girl coming for you.\nAnother tool to wake up fresh is to use wake up light alarm clocks. It will wake you up by first turning on the a light which will increase in brightness, and eventually go over to sounds. Some models have nature sounds and others just normal beeping sounds. It’s a pretty neat way to wake up and takes away that choking beep normal alarms give you.\n\n\nDon’t snooze\n\nDon’t snooze. Don’t ever hit that snooze button man, c'mon you know better than that. I don’t have to explain this much more but just knock fudge out of that alarm clock and let it know who’s the boss, then you want to count from 5 backwards to zero, like you’re taking of with a rocket. Once you reach 0 you’re up and away. It really is that simple and you’ll be up within 10 seconds of the alarm going off. \n\nMe personally, I just go full savage and place my alarm clock on the other side of the room or in the kitchen with full volume. \n\nHave a reason\n\nThe number one thing for making this habit stick is that you should want to get up, just like you wanted to get up for christmas as a kid. You can’t convince yourself to wake up early just because, there has to be a reason for you waking up.\n\nOne thing that get’s me to follow any habit is the checklist manifesto. It’s such a powerful way of getting things done and it’s so easy to implement. All you need to do is to simply create a list of things you want to do the night before you go to bed and put boxes beside every task.\n\nFor instance my first five tasks is to make my bed, do 40 push ups, drink a full glass of water, have a shot of ACV and then take a walk while listening to an audiobook. These five tasks only takes me about 20-25 minutes to accomplish and after that I’ll make some coffee and then I’m fully awake and I go onto some more productive work such as working on these videos.\n\nAnd if you want to be almost as cool as me and listen to audiobooks, you can sign up through my audible link to their 30 day free trial and get 2 books for free.

Joe Posner, and Michael Bierut (designer of the Hillary Clinton logo) explain. For more from Michael Bierut on graphic design, check out his book \"How to use graphic design to sell things, explain things, make things look better, make people laugh, cry, and (every once in a while) change the world\": http://www.amazon.com/How-Michael-Bierut/dp/0062413902 \n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nAbout once a month, there's a new logo to fight about on the internet. The biggest one in recent memory was the highly controversial Hillary Clinton logo, which did not escape scrutiny from Vox.com either. \n\nBut as a designer/filmmaker, something about these repeated discussions struck me as missing the point on what makes logos tick. It often has little to do with the subjective musings. So I called up Michael Bierut, the designer of that Hillary Clinton logo and countless others. He sat down with me and helped explain the elements of a great logo in the video above. \n\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

For more from Michael Bierut on graphic design, check out his book \"How to use graphic design to sell things, explain things, make things look better, make people laugh, cry, and (every once in a while) change the world\": http://www.amazon.com/How-Michael-Bierut/dp/0062413902 \n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nAbout once a month, there's a new logo to fight about on the internet. The biggest one in recent memory was the highly controversial Hillary Clinton logo, which did not escape scrutiny from Vox.com either. \n\nBut as a designer/filmmaker, something about these repeated discussions struck me as missing the point on what makes logos tick. It often has little to do with the subjective musings. So I called up Michael Bierut, the designer of that Hillary Clinton logo and countless others. He sat down with me and helped explain the elements of a great logo in the video above. \n\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Thankfully in the US this is made easy by the FCC. In our demo we're using this remote control power outlet. It's a cheap simple $10 device that you can get off Amazon with the FCC ID PAGTR-009-1B.\n\nhttp://amzn.to/1PejY58\nhttps://fccid.io/document.php?id=1729526\n\nHere we can see it's originally manufactured by Verdant Electronics (Dong Guan) Co., Ltd. out of China and if we pull up the actual test report from the lab we'll figure out that it transmits at 314.9020 MHz using ASK modulation with 80 kHz of bandwidth using a 12 volt battery and an integrated antenna. This lab report even includes a picture of the waveform we'll be reproducing soon.\n\nStep 2: Sniffing the Signal\n\nSo now we know where to look for the signal, at 314.9020 MHz and that it's using ASK or Amplitude Shift Key modulation. Using one of my favorite tools, the RTL-SDR, we can now sniff that signal up for analysis. To do so we used GQRX on Kali Linux 2.0. \n\nIt's just a matter of tuning the RTL-SDR dongle to the 315 MHz frequency and recording the signal.\n\n315 MHz isn't technically an unlicensed ISM band like WiFi, but the FCC has a license free part 15 band for \"Short Range Devices\" which commonly use 315 MHz. In Europe you'll more commonly find 433 MHz.\n\nStep 3: Identifying and Decoding the Signal\n\nSince we're dealing with radio signals -- actual waveforms rather than digital wireless packets or frames like with WiFi -- we don't have the luxury of using an analyzer like Wireshark. Rather in this case I'm just going to open up the file in the audio editor Audacity.\n\nAnd here if we zoom in we'll see the actual signal. What's happening here is when the remote button is pressed we get these pulses. This is what's known as On-Off-Keying, and it's the simplest form of amplitude-shift keying modulation. In this case a pulse is a binary 1 and the absence of a pulse is a binary zero. It's sort of like CW or Morse Code.\n\nMore on OOK: https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/app-notes/index.mvp/id/4439\n\nStep 4: Decoding the Signal \n\nLooking at the wave form we can determine a 1 by a pulse and a 0 by the lack there of. Measuring out the distance of a single pulse helps identify two more more consecutive pulses.\n\nLooking at our wave form we get 10001110 11101000 11101000 10001000 10001000 11101000 10001000 10001000. If we convert this to hex in the command line, say with this bash one-liner:  printf '%x\\n' \"$((2#10001110))\"\n\nAlternatively just search for a binary to hex converter and what we end up with is 8E E8 E8 88 88 E8 88 88.\n\nThe last bit we need to know is the data rate - or how fast each chirp in the On-Off-Keying is transmitted.\n\nTo do that we'll just need to select one of the one or zero bits in our audio editor Audacity and determine how long in seconds each bit lasts. In our case it's going at a speed of 0.00055 seconds, or 550 microseconds, which is about 1800 bits per second. \n\nStep 4: Sending the Replay Attack\n\nFinally we fire up RfCat to perform the replay attack. First we'll need to set the frequency with d.setFreq(315060000).\n\nNext we'll need to set the modulation to On-Off-Keying with Amplitude Shift Keying with d.setMdmModulation(MOD_ASK_OOK)\n\nThen it's the data rate which we figured out to be about 550 microseconds so that'll be d.setMdmDRate(int(1.0/0.000550))\n\nFinally we can inject the hex values we converted with d.RFxmit(\"\\x8E\\xE8\\xE8\\x88\\x88\\xE8\\x88\\x88\\x00\\x00\\x00\" * 40)\n\nd.RFxmit will transmit the hex values using the parameters we just set and I've gone ahead and added three null bytes at the end because we want to transmit the signal over and over a few times to make sure the receiver picks it up -- in this case I'm using * 40 to transmit the binary data 40 times.\n\nIf all goes well, you should be mimicking the action of the remote signal captured in step 2.\n\nRead more in our show notes at http://hak5.org\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nPlease watch: \"Bash Bunny Primer - Hak5  2225\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j6hrjSrJaM\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F3bISk5t8cA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F3bISk5t8cA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F3bISk5t8cA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F3bISk5t8cA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F3bISk5t8cA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Hak5","tags":["Replay Attack","Hacker (Character Power)","Hacker (Interest)","How-to (Website Category)","Cracking Of Wireless Networks","Radio","YARD Stick One","cc1111","ook","ask","on off keying","Wireless LAN (Industry)","hacking","how to","tutorial","wireless remotes","internet of things","hak5","darren kitchen","shannon morse","mike ossmann","great scott gadgets"],"categoryId":"28","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"How to Hack Wireless Remotes with Radio Replay Attacks - Hak5 1909","description":"Today we're hacking wireless remotes using RF replay attacks using the YARD Stick One! \n\nFull show notes at http://hak5.org -- Wireless Gear including the YARD Stick One at http://hakshop.com\n\nIn this episode we cover: \n\n- How to gather intel on the device you want to hack\n- How to sniff its wireless signals\n- Determining modulation\n- Decode OOK signals\n- Transmitting a Replay Attack with RfCat and the YARD Stick One\n\nStep 1: Gathering Intel \n\nFirst up we need to identify the device we're going to hack and figure out as much about it as possible.

With this blank slate, I had an opportunity to improve on my older automated system that worked off a key pad. I wanted the ability to simply turn on a tool and the dust collector would fire up and all the blast gates to close like they should.\nIn a shop with many tools, there are valves that can isolate the suction to help improve air flow, the more tools you have, the more gates you would have to close in order to use one tool. With the help of an Arduino micro controller, I was hoping to automatically control these gates and have the DC turn on and off with the tool.\n\nThere are commercially available systems that do this, but they are expensive and don't offer a way to add additional IoT functions later. Eventually, I'm hoping to connect the system to other sensors set up around the room to make the ultimate workshop of the future!\n\nI started by laying out the pipes that would connect the DC to each tool in the most efficient way. I found some drainage piping at Lowe's which was much cheaper than traditional PVC pipe. Because the walls of this drainage pipe were thinner than regular PVC, most of the blast gates and fittings wouldn't connect.  Josh designed and 3d printed a bunch of adapters to connect the whole system together. After connecting all of the tools to the pipes and fittings, we played it safe and added a ground wire from one of the pipes to an existing ground wire in the basement. This is said to prevent static buildup which could be dangerous in a dusty environment, so I added it just in case.\n\nWith the ducting in place, I focused on the sensors that would read the amperage spike when each tool is turned on.  I made a housing that the tools would plug into to receive power and also connect to the voltage detector that connects to the Arduino. Once you turn on a tool, an amperage spike is detected and an input signal tells the Arduino to shuttle the appropriate blast gates and to trip the relay that controls the DC. The blast gates are controlled by a servo mounted on a bracket that swings an arm connected to the gate. When the servo moves, the arm pushes or pulls the gate open or closed.\n\nThere are a lot of components to this system so managing all of the wires, plugs, connectors, and servos was very important. All of the connecters were pinned and protected with heat shrink, all of the wires were bundled and labeled, and the servos were dialed in to make sure the gates weren't hitting any hard stops.\n\nThe system works great except for one component that kept giving us trouble. The 15 amp relay that was controlling the dust collector would fail after a few days. After some research, I discovered that they were a bit underpowered for the 2 horsepower DC. I have ordered a beefier relay and when we get it hooked up and working, it'll be listed here. If you want the Arduino code for I made for this project, you can find it here.\n\nI hope this project inspires you streamline your workflow and find ways to improve efficiency in your shop or home.

Limestone is basically calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The general source of lime is limestone and various other calcareous minerals, though shells, egg shells and coral are other sources of lime (for more information see video on Corporals Corner channel: https://youtu.be/tOhAfaFboNU or Skillcults channel: https://youtu.be/jOxaOTUGuKo). When heated above 840 degrees Celsius, the lime decomposes into calcium oxide (CaO) or Quicklime and releases carbon dioxide (CO2). When water is added to the quicklime it becomes calcium hydroxide Ca (OH)2 or lime putty. From here the calcium hydroxide can then be shaped into a form and allowed to set. Carbon dioxide enters the lime putty as it dries causing it to turn back into calcium carbonate. The new calcium carbonate has then set, remaining solid and water resistant. \nIn my local geography, calcareous rocks such as limestone are absent leading to a difficulty in acquiring the feed stock for lime making. However, I was still able to make lime by collecting the shells of large terrestrial snails that are native to the rainforest here. The unoccupied shells of these snails were gathered up and stored at the hut. Fire wood was gathered and packed neatly into the kiln. Importantly, the firewood was stacked on top of the grate rather than underneath it in the firebox as is the normal procedure for firing pottery. Using an ordinary updraft pottery kiln in this configuration allows it to reach much higher temperatures than would be possible during normal use. The wood was lit from above and the fire burned down towards the grate. Alternate layers of shells and wood were added on to this burning fuel bed. After adding the last layer of wood to act as a “lid” to prevent heat loss from above I left the kiln to finish on its own, unsupervised. The whole process took about an hour and a half.\nWhen the kiln had cooled down a few hours later, I took out the calcined shells. Not shown in the video was the fact that some shells got so hot, the dirt stuck to them turned into slag and fused to them, possibly with the lime acting a flux lowering its melting point. This extreme heat (+1200 c) should be avoided as the over burnt lime becomes “dead lime”, unable to slake in water. Most shells were still useable though. They were taken out of the kiln and had water added to them. An exothermic reaction then ensued. Heat was produced as the lime quicklime turned into slaked lime. The water heated up creating steam and the shells decomposed into a white paste. The paste was stirred and crushed pottery was added to it as an aggregate (sand is normally used for this, I just had a lot of old pot sherds lying about to dispose of). This lime mortar mixture was then formed into a block shape and left to dry. It took about a week and a half to set as we have had extremely humid, wet weather. The block was observed to have set demonstrating its properties.\nWhat I created is actually lime mortar, typically used for mortaring bricks and tiles together. It’s basically the ‘Glue’ that holds together the building blocks of masonry structures. From my research 20 kg of lime mortar is used on a 1 m square section of brick wall. 5 kg of lime to 15 kg of aggregate (sand, grog etc.) per a 1 m square section of bricks. The shells, though large, are not terribly abundant. A method for finding shells efficiently needs to be made before considering making lime mortar in this fashion. From my experience sand bars in a creek sometimes accumulate snail shells from higher up in the mountains. In these spots, water velocity decreases and shells in the water tend to drop out of the water column. Additionally lime may be partially replaced with ordinary wood ash in mortar without a corresponding decrease in strength. To conclude, making lime in a land without limestone is possible but can be problematic when trying to do so on a large scale.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ek3aeUhHaFY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ek3aeUhHaFY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ek3aeUhHaFY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ek3aeUhHaFY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ek3aeUhHaFY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Primitive Technology","categoryId":"22","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Primitive Technology: Lime","description":"At the old hut site (the new one being temporarily cut off by flooding) I made lime mortar from the shells of rainforest snails by firing them in a kiln, slaking them in water, mixing them into lime putty.

The ultimate wake up early motivation.\n\nFirst you need to know how much sleep you need to not feel like shit when you wake up, and know that you can actually get too much sleep and feel lazy for the rest of the day. The perfect amount of sleep is most often between 5-9 hours and I challenge you to set the alarm earlier than you normally would to sleep less than usual just to evaluate how you feel. \n\nOptimize your environment\n\nEliminate sources of light and try to block it all out. Shove the tv out if you have one in your bedroom and instead pick up a book to read. Preferably fiction rather than business or self-help as that will trigger your brain and you’ll get all sorts of cool ideas that will hinder you from falling asleep. \nThere are a lot of techniques you can use to fall asleep faster and wake up fresh, and I’ve made a video about 6 uncommon tips that will definitely speed this process up.\nBut some more common things or tools you can use that will optimize your sleeping environment is white noise machines. It’s a tool that reduces the distracting effect of outsides noises for a more relaxing environment. It’s almost like a heavenly fan without the breeze, just the sound. \nAnd this might sound awful to you but it’s highly effective for falling asleep because you won’t notice those weird random noises that you otherwise would be convinced is the ring girl coming for you.\nAnother tool to wake up fresh is to use wake up light alarm clocks. It will wake you up by first turning on the a light which will increase in brightness, and eventually go over to sounds. Some models have nature sounds and others just normal beeping sounds. It’s a pretty neat way to wake up and takes away that choking beep normal alarms give you.\n\n\nDon’t snooze\n\nDon’t snooze. Don’t ever hit that snooze button man, c'mon you know better than that. I don’t have to explain this much more but just knock fudge out of that alarm clock and let it know who’s the boss, then you want to count from 5 backwards to zero, like you’re taking of with a rocket. Once you reach 0 you’re up and away. It really is that simple and you’ll be up within 10 seconds of the alarm going off. \n\nMe personally, I just go full savage and place my alarm clock on the other side of the room or in the kitchen with full volume. \n\nHave a reason\n\nThe number one thing for making this habit stick is that you should want to get up, just like you wanted to get up for christmas as a kid. You can’t convince yourself to wake up early just because, there has to be a reason for you waking up.\n\nOne thing that get’s me to follow any habit is the checklist manifesto.

The ultimate wake up early motivation.\n\nFirst you need to know how much sleep you need to not feel like shit when you wake up, and know that you can actually get too much sleep and feel lazy for the rest of the day. The perfect amount of sleep is most often between 5-9 hours and I challenge you to set the alarm earlier than you normally would to sleep less than usual just to evaluate how you feel. \n\nOptimize your environment\n\nEliminate sources of light and try to block it all out. Shove the tv out if you have one in your bedroom and instead pick up a book to read. Preferably fiction rather than business or self-help as that will trigger your brain and you’ll get all sorts of cool ideas that will hinder you from falling asleep. \nThere are a lot of techniques you can use to fall asleep faster and wake up fresh, and I’ve made a video about 6 uncommon tips that will definitely speed this process up.\nBut some more common things or tools you can use that will optimize your sleeping environment is white noise machines. It’s a tool that reduces the distracting effect of outsides noises for a more relaxing environment. It’s almost like a heavenly fan without the breeze, just the sound. \nAnd this might sound awful to you but it’s highly effective for falling asleep because you won’t notice those weird random noises that you otherwise would be convinced is the ring girl coming for you.\nAnother tool to wake up fresh is to use wake up light alarm clocks. It will wake you up by first turning on the a light which will increase in brightness, and eventually go over to sounds. Some models have nature sounds and others just normal beeping sounds. It’s a pretty neat way to wake up and takes away that choking beep normal alarms give you.\n\n\nDon’t snooze\n\nDon’t snooze. Don’t ever hit that snooze button man, c'mon you know better than that. I don’t have to explain this much more but just knock fudge out of that alarm clock and let it know who’s the boss, then you want to count from 5 backwards to zero, like you’re taking of with a rocket. Once you reach 0 you’re up and away. It really is that simple and you’ll be up within 10 seconds of the alarm going off. \n\nMe personally, I just go full savage and place my alarm clock on the other side of the room or in the kitchen with full volume. \n\nHave a reason\n\nThe number one thing for making this habit stick is that you should want to get up, just like you wanted to get up for christmas as a kid. You can’t convince yourself to wake up early just because, there has to be a reason for you waking up.\n\nOne thing that get’s me to follow any habit is the checklist manifesto. It’s such a powerful way of getting things done and it’s so easy to implement. All you need to do is to simply create a list of things you want to do the night before you go to bed and put boxes beside every task.\n\nFor instance my first five tasks is to make my bed, do 40 push ups, drink a full glass of water, have a shot of ACV and then take a walk while listening to an audiobook. These five tasks only takes me about 20-25 minutes to accomplish and after that I’ll make some coffee and then I’m fully awake and I go onto some more productive work such as working on these videos.\n\nAnd if you want to be almost as cool as me and listen to audiobooks, you can sign up through my audible link to their 30 day free trial and get 2 books for free.

Joe Posner, and Michael Bierut (designer of the Hillary Clinton logo) explain. For more from Michael Bierut on graphic design, check out his book \"How to use graphic design to sell things, explain things, make things look better, make people laugh, cry, and (every once in a while) change the world\": http://www.amazon.com/How-Michael-Bierut/dp/0062413902 \n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nAbout once a month, there's a new logo to fight about on the internet. The biggest one in recent memory was the highly controversial Hillary Clinton logo, which did not escape scrutiny from Vox.com either. \n\nBut as a designer/filmmaker, something about these repeated discussions struck me as missing the point on what makes logos tick. It often has little to do with the subjective musings. So I called up Michael Bierut, the designer of that Hillary Clinton logo and countless others. He sat down with me and helped explain the elements of a great logo in the video above. \n\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

For more from Michael Bierut on graphic design, check out his book \"How to use graphic design to sell things, explain things, make things look better, make people laugh, cry, and (every once in a while) change the world\": http://www.amazon.com/How-Michael-Bierut/dp/0062413902 \n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nAbout once a month, there's a new logo to fight about on the internet. The biggest one in recent memory was the highly controversial Hillary Clinton logo, which did not escape scrutiny from Vox.com either. \n\nBut as a designer/filmmaker, something about these repeated discussions struck me as missing the point on what makes logos tick. It often has little to do with the subjective musings. So I called up Michael Bierut, the designer of that Hillary Clinton logo and countless others. He sat down with me and helped explain the elements of a great logo in the video above. \n\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
