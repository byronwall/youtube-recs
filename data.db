Yet being homeless twice and being abandoned by his wife early on didn't shake his drive to make it in this word, and he's managed to turn an admittedly difficult hand into a royal flush. These days he's a billionaire several times over with a successful Paul Mitchell haircare line and even a founding stake in Patron tequila brand. So how did he maintain motivation? He remembered giving two dimes to the Salvation Army as a boy, and how his mother told him that those dimes add up and can really help people. This lesson directly helped him overcome a period early in his career where he was collecting bottle caps to get money to eat.\n\nGOOD FORTUNE, a documentary based on John Paul's life, is available on all digital platforms on August 1st\n\nRead more at BigThink.com: http://bigthink.com/videos/john-paul-dejoria-how-i-overcame-homelessness-twice-to-become-a-billionaire\n\nFollow Big Think here:\nYouTube: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcom\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthink\n\nTranscript:  A lot of people ask how I got into donating to various causes, and how I got involved in even homelessness along the way, and popped out of it—well it's a very interesting story. My mom has a lot to do with it.\n\nAt six years old we didn't have any money; there was my mother, my brother and I. We had a deadbeat dad; left us before we were two, but she took us at Christmas-time to downtown Los Angeles. We had little cars going around in circles, it was pretty cool, and decorations in the window.\n\nShe gave my brother and I a dime and told us, \"Boys whole half of it each, give it to the man ringing the bell in the bucket.\" We put it in this bucket, we said, \"Mom, why did we give that man a dime? That's like two soda pops.\" This is 1951, two soda pops, three candy bars.\n\nAnd mom said, \"Boys, that's the Salvation Army. They take care of people that have no place to live and no food. And we don't have a lot of money, but we can afford a dime this year. Boys, always remember in life: give a little something to those in need, they'll always be somebody that's not as well-off as you are. No matter where you are or how far down you are, try and help someone along the way.\" It stuck with me.\n\nThe first time I was homeless I was 22-and-a-half years older and I had a two-and-a-half year old son. I was working as the Master of Ceremonies at the Second Annual Sports Vacation Recreational Vehicle Show and I had a check coming in at the end of the week.\n\nWell, I came home and I drove our one car up to where we lived and as I was getting out of the car and going up towards our apartment door my wife—we were very young, we got married at 20 and 19 years old—my wife was coming down the stairs and she said, \"I'm going to storage,\" and she took the keys. By the time I got through the door I saw my little boy, two and a half years old, kind of just sitting there on top of a pile of clothes with a note that basically said, “I can't handle being a mom anymore. He'll be much better off with you. Good luck.”\n\nNow, what I didn't know also was that she had planned this for a few months. She had not paid the rent for a few months and kept the money and I didn't know that. She wiped out what little we had in the savings account in the bank and took the only car we had. So unbeknownst to me, two days later I was evicted—completely evicted, power shut off, the landlord—she just really timed this one.

Yet being homeless twice and being abandoned by his wife early on didn't shake his drive to make it in this word, and he's managed to turn an admittedly difficult hand into a royal flush. These days he's a billionaire several times over with a successful Paul Mitchell haircare line and even a founding stake in Patron tequila brand. So how did he maintain motivation? He remembered giving two dimes to the Salvation Army as a boy, and how his mother told him that those dimes add up and can really help people. This lesson directly helped him overcome a period early in his career where he was collecting bottle caps to get money to eat.\n\nGOOD FORTUNE, a documentary based on John Paul's life, is available on all digital platforms on August 1st\n\nRead more at BigThink.com: http://bigthink.com/videos/john-paul-dejoria-how-i-overcame-homelessness-twice-to-become-a-billionaire\n\nFollow Big Think here:\nYouTube: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcom\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthink\n\nTranscript:  A lot of people ask how I got into donating to various causes, and how I got involved in even homelessness along the way, and popped out of it—well it's a very interesting story. My mom has a lot to do with it.\n\nAt six years old we didn't have any money; there was my mother, my brother and I. We had a deadbeat dad; left us before we were two, but she took us at Christmas-time to downtown Los Angeles. We had little cars going around in circles, it was pretty cool, and decorations in the window.\n\nShe gave my brother and I a dime and told us, \"Boys whole half of it each, give it to the man ringing the bell in the bucket.\" We put it in this bucket, we said, \"Mom, why did we give that man a dime? That's like two soda pops.\" This is 1951, two soda pops, three candy bars.\n\nAnd mom said, \"Boys, that's the Salvation Army. They take care of people that have no place to live and no food. And we don't have a lot of money, but we can afford a dime this year. Boys, always remember in life: give a little something to those in need, they'll always be somebody that's not as well-off as you are. No matter where you are or how far down you are, try and help someone along the way.\" It stuck with me.\n\nThe first time I was homeless I was 22-and-a-half years older and I had a two-and-a-half year old son. I was working as the Master of Ceremonies at the Second Annual Sports Vacation Recreational Vehicle Show and I had a check coming in at the end of the week.\n\nWell, I came home and I drove our one car up to where we lived and as I was getting out of the car and going up towards our apartment door my wife—we were very young, we got married at 20 and 19 years old—my wife was coming down the stairs and she said, \"I'm going to storage,\" and she took the keys. By the time I got through the door I saw my little boy, two and a half years old, kind of just sitting there on top of a pile of clothes with a note that basically said, “I can't handle being a mom anymore. He'll be much better off with you. Good luck.”\n\nNow, what I didn't know also was that she had planned this for a few months. She had not paid the rent for a few months and kept the money and I didn't know that. She wiped out what little we had in the savings account in the bank and took the only car we had. So unbeknownst to me, two days later I was evicted—completely evicted, power shut off, the landlord—she just really timed this one. And I had this little kid with me, two-and-a-half years old, and now I had to be mom and dad and that was really a bummer, I had no car! So I ended up borrowing a 1951 Cadillac with a broken water pump from someone that was very, very dear, had to put water in it every four hours, and that's kind of how we got going.\n\nSecond time I was homeless is when I started John Paul Mitchell Systems. I knew I needed $500,000 to start John Paul Mitchell Systems, had to have that. So we had the backer lined up, I had a good job at the time, lived in a nice house, and I left everything I had because $500,000 was coming down the street, I was going to start a company. So I left it all behind. I left what money I had with my wife—we weren't getting along well at all—and the best car.

The area's transformation happened gradually, over a period of more than 100 years. Here's how.\n\nSilicon Valley is an almost $3 trillion neighborhood thanks to companies like Apple, Google, and Tesla. But it wasn't always this way.\n\nIn the late 1800s, San Francisco's port helped make it a hub of the early telegraph and radio industries. In 1909, San José became home to one of the US's first radio stations. In 1933, the Navy purchased Moffett Field to dock and maintain the USS Macon. This made Moffett Field a major hub for the early days of the aerospace industry. Many scientists and researchers all found work in the area. In 1939, the Ames Research Center was founded in the area, and it became home to the world's largest wind tunnel in 1949.\n\nAlso in 1939, William Hewlett and Dave Packard founded Hewlett-Packard in Palo Alto, which originally made oscilloscopes. Then, during World War II, HP made radar and artillery technology. At this point, computers were about the size of a room.\n\nIn the 1940s, William Shockley coinvented the transistor while at Bell Labs. The transistor is now known as the computer processor.

The area's transformation happened gradually, over a period of more than 100 years. Here's how.\n\nSilicon Valley is an almost $3 trillion neighborhood thanks to companies like Apple, Google, and Tesla. But it wasn't always this way.\n\nIn the late 1800s, San Francisco's port helped make it a hub of the early telegraph and radio industries. In 1909, San José became home to one of the US's first radio stations. In 1933, the Navy purchased Moffett Field to dock and maintain the USS Macon. This made Moffett Field a major hub for the early days of the aerospace industry. Many scientists and researchers all found work in the area. In 1939, the Ames Research Center was founded in the area, and it became home to the world's largest wind tunnel in 1949.\n\nAlso in 1939, William Hewlett and Dave Packard founded Hewlett-Packard in Palo Alto, which originally made oscilloscopes. Then, during World War II, HP made radar and artillery technology. At this point, computers were about the size of a room.\n\nIn the 1940s, William Shockley coinvented the transistor while at Bell Labs. The transistor is now known as the computer processor. In 1956, Shockley left Bell and founded his own company — Shockley Semiconductor Labs. It was the first company to make transistors out of silicon and not germanium. The company was founded in Mountain View, California — so Shockley could be closer to his sick mother. Shockley's company employed many recent grads of Stanford.\n\nIn 1957, eight Shockley employees grew tired of his demeanor and left the company.

The insert has to withstand extreme heat and force, so it’s made of some of the hardest material in the world. \n\nWe take you to the Sandvik Coromant's world class insert production facility at Gimo, Sweden to witness how an insert is made. See how it's done!\n\nTranscript\nAlmost everything made of metal is machined with an insert. The insert has to withstand extreme heat and force, so it’s made of some of the hardest material in the world.\n\nA typical insert is made of 80% tungsten carbide and a metal matrix that binds the hard carbide grains together, where cobalt is the most common. It takes more than two days to produce an insert, so it’s a complicated process. \n\nIn the material warehouse, row after row of raw material are stacked. The tungsten carbide we use is either recycled, or comes from our own mine in Austria. Cobalt, titanium and all other ingredients come from carefully selected suppliers; each batch meticulously tested in the lab.\n\nSome recipes contain very small amounts of selected ingredients that are added by hand. The main ingredients are then automatically dispensed at the different stops along the weigh line. \n\nIn the milling room the ingredients are milled to the required particle size together with ethanol, water and an organic binder. This process takes from eight to 55 hours, depending on the recipe.\n\nThe slurry is pumped into a spray drier where hot nitrogen gas is sprayed to evaporate the ethanol and water mixture. When the powder is dry, it consists of spherical granules of identical sizes. A sample is sent to the lab for quality check.\n\nBarrels of 100 kilograms of ready-to-press powder arrive at the pressing machine. The binder added in the milling room is the binder that holds the powder together after pressing. Up to 12 tons of pressure are applied, depending on the type of insert. The binder added in the milling room is what holds the powder together after pressing. The process is completely automated. Each insert is weighed and at certain intervals controlled visually by the operator.\n\nThe pressed inserts are very fragile and need to be hardened in a sintering oven. This process takes about 13 hours at a temperature of approximately 1,500 degrees Celsius. The inserts are sintered into an extremely hard cemented-carbide product, almost as hard as diamond. The organic binder is incinerated and the insert shrinks approximately to half its original size. The excess heat is recycled and used to heat the premises in the winter, and cool them down during summer.\n\nThe inserts are ground, one by one, in different types of grinding machines to achieve the exact size, geometry and tolerances. As the cemented carbide insert is so hard, a disc with 150 million small industrial diamonds, is used to grind it. The excess carbide is recycled, as well as the oil that is used as cutting fluid.\n\nThe majority of inserts are coated, either through chemical vapour deposition (CVD) or physical vapour deposition (PVD). Here, we see a PVD-process. \nThe inserts are placed in fixtures...  \n…and put into the oven. \nThe thin layer of coating makes the insert both harder and tougher. This is also where the insert gets its specific colour.\n\nAlthough the insert has been inspected at the lab regularly during the whole process, it’s manually examined again before it’s laser marked and packed. \nAfter labelling, the grey boxes are ready to be sent out to manufacturers around the world.\n\nWhen the inserts are worn out, they are returned to Sandvik Coromant for recycling, and the process of making a new insert begins.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0QrynzJ_lZ4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0QrynzJ_lZ4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0QrynzJ_lZ4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0QrynzJ_lZ4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0QrynzJ_lZ4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Sandvik Coromant","tags":["How inserts are made","carbide inserts","inserts","grades","inserts and grades","turning","milling","drilling","metalworking","machining metal","Gimo","Sandvik Coromant","recycling","wolfram","automation","tungsten","tungsten inserts","tungsten carbide inserts","how to make a carbide insert","cemented carbide"],"categoryId":"28","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"How carbide inserts are made by Sandvik Coromant","description":"Carbide inserts are used to machine almost  everything made of metal.

This process takes from eight to 55 hours, depending on the recipe.\n\nThe slurry is pumped into a spray drier where hot nitrogen gas is sprayed to evaporate the ethanol and water mixture. When the powder is dry, it consists of spherical granules of identical sizes. A sample is sent to the lab for quality check.\n\nBarrels of 100 kilograms of ready-to-press powder arrive at the pressing machine. The binder added in the milling room is the binder that holds the powder together after pressing. Up to 12 tons of pressure are applied, depending on the type of insert. The binder added in the milling room is what holds the powder together after pressing. The process is completely automated. Each insert is weighed and at certain intervals controlled visually by the operator.\n\nThe pressed inserts are very fragile and need to be hardened in a sintering oven. This process takes about 13 hours at a temperature of approximately 1,500 degrees Celsius. The inserts are sintered into an extremely hard cemented-carbide product, almost as hard as diamond. The organic binder is incinerated and the insert shrinks approximately to half its original size. The excess heat is recycled and used to heat the premises in the winter, and cool them down during summer.\n\nThe inserts are ground, one by one, in different types of grinding machines to achieve the exact size, geometry and tolerances. As the cemented carbide insert is so hard, a disc with 150 million small industrial diamonds, is used to grind it. The excess carbide is recycled, as well as the oil that is used as cutting fluid.\n\nThe majority of inserts are coated, either through chemical vapour deposition (CVD) or physical vapour deposition (PVD). Here, we see a PVD-process. \nThe inserts are placed in fixtures...  \n…and put into the oven. \nThe thin layer of coating makes the insert both harder and tougher. This is also where the insert gets its specific colour.\n\nAlthough the insert has been inspected at the lab regularly during the whole process, it’s manually examined again before it’s laser marked and packed. \nAfter labelling, the grey boxes are ready to be sent out to manufacturers around the world.\n\nWhen the inserts are worn out, they are returned to Sandvik Coromant for recycling, and the process of making a new insert begins."},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT6M20S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"true","licensedContent":false,"projection":"rectangular"},"statistics":{"viewCount":197159,"likeCount":3194,"dislikeCount":43,"favoriteCount":0,"commentCount":164},"_id":"6ZAlnu6X7fA4EIKH","ratio":74.27906976744185,"score":14644787.11627907}

You sit down and you focus on it. So you focus and you’re activating task-positive networks. And then what happens is you’re working away and then you start to get frustrated. You can’t figure out what’s going on. What’s happening is you’re focusing and you’re using one small area of your brain to analyze the material. But it isn’t the right circuit to actually understand and comprehend the material. So you get frustrated. You finally give up, and then when you give up and get your attention off it it turns out that you activate a completely different type of or set of neural circuits. That’s the default mode network and the related neural circuits. So what happens is you stop thinking about it, you relax, you go off for a walk, you take a shower. You’re doing something different. And in the background this default mode network is doing some sort of neural processing on the side. And then what happens is you come back and voila, suddenly the information makes sense. And, in fact, it can suddenly seem so easy that you can’t figure out why you didn’t understand it before. So learning often involves going back and forth between these two different neural modes – focus mode and what I often call diffuse mode which involves **** resting states. You can only be in one mode at the same time\n\nSo you might wonder, is there a certain task that is more appropriate for focus mode or diffuse mode? The reality is that learning involves going back and forth between these two modes. You often have to focus at first in order to sort of load that information into your brain and then you do something different, get your attention off it and that’s when that background processing occurs. And this happens no matter what you’re learning. Whether you’re learning something in math and science, you’re learning a new language, learning music, a dance. Even learning to back up a car. And think about it this way. Here’s a very important related idea and that is that when you’re learning something new you want to create a well practiced neural pattern that you can easily draw to mind when you need it. So this is called a neural chunk and chunking theory is incredibly important in learning. So, for example, if you are trying to learn to back up a car when you first begin it’s crazy, right. You’re looking all around. Do you look in this mirror or this mirror or do you look behind you? What do you do? It’s this crazy set of information. But after you’ve practiced a while you develop this very nice sort of pattern that’s well practiced. So all you have to do is think I’m going to back up a car. Instantly that pattern comes to mind and you’re able to back up a car. Not only are you doing that but you’re maybe talking to friends, listening to the radio. It’s that well practiced neural chunk that makes it seem easy. So it’s important in any kind of learning to create these well practiced patterns. And the bigger the library of these patterns, the more well practiced sort of deeper and broader they are as neural patterns in your mind, the more expertise you have in that topic. \n\nAnd chunking was first sort of thought of or explored by Nobel Prize Winner [Herbert] Simon who found that, if you’re a chess master, that the higher you’re ranking in chess, the more patterns of chess you have memorized. So you could access more and more patterns of chess.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1FvYJhpNvHY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1FvYJhpNvHY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1FvYJhpNvHY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1FvYJhpNvHY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1FvYJhpNvHY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Big Think","tags":["Big Think","BigThink","BigThink.com","Education","Educational","Lifelong Learning","EDU","barbara oakley","neural networks","brain","neuroscience","neural chunking"],"categoryId":"27","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"The Science of Learning: How to Turn Information into Intelligence | Barbara Oakley","description":"Cramming for a test and having a hard time understanding something?

Nobody knows this better than Bryan Cranston, who spent two consecutive years (at 19 and 20) on a motorcycle with his brother, exploring America and figuring out what it was that he wanted to do with the rest of his life. Needless to say he became a major figure in American acting. With pivotal roles in Breaking Bad and Trumbo that—no exaggeration here—have helped reshape not only American television but American masculinity, it shows just how meaningful being purposefully lost can be. That way, you can truly find yourself.\n\nRead more at BigThink.com: http://bigthink.com/videos/bryan-cranston-theres-one-thing-all-young-people-should-do\n\nFollow Big Think here:\nYouTube: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcom\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthink\n\n----\nBryan Cranston: You know Americans have a lot of great qualities, and one of them is a general work ethic. I think we’re a nation of hard workers.\n\nAnd that being said I think sometimes we reach down too far into our youth and expect them to produce sooner than they should be able to.\n\nI think people gain a tremendous amount of wisdom when they travel, when they wander—when they allow themselves, as I did, to get lost. And maybe you’ll find yourself somewhere. Or at least traveling forces you to be social. You have to get directions, you have to learn where things are, you’re attuned to your environment, you have to be more careful about the weather and where you’re lodging is going to be, where you’re going to eat, how you’re going to get from one place to another.\n\nWhen you’re there what is it you want to see? How can you find a place for you to actually just rest? It’s an experience like no other. I love to travel and I enjoy not knowing where I am. It’s an unusual thing. I’d purposefully teach that to my daughter, who’s now 24 years old, to not be afraid of not knowing where you are. So I’ll go for a drive or go for a walk in a different city and my wife will say, “Do you know where you’re going?” “Not really. Just kind of exploring different places.” As long as you have a sense of direction you’ll find your way, you’ll figure it out. And I do that in foreign countries as well: Just kind of wander and meander and trust that you’ve paid attention to at least the basic requirement of where you have to get back to in order to find your way home.\n\nBut I think it is, I think we look down now to 16 year olds and say, “Where are you going to go to college? What are you going to do for the rest of your life?” And it's like... they’re not fully baked yet! How do they know? Give them a break.\n\nJust say, look, “I think after high school take a year off, take two years off. Join the Peace Corps. Travel. Go figure things out or just enjoy yourself.”\n\nFor the first time in their lives they’re adults and they don’t have to be somewhere. They’re not told to be somewhere. Get used to that freedom. Get used to having the need to self-govern yourself, to be able to employ self-discipline—or not. Or you realize “Oh my god, I’m really slovenly! If I’m not told I need to go to class I don’t go.” You might discover something about yourself.\n\n“I need order. I need that. I like that.” Some people love to be, say, “this is where you have to be and this is what you need to do.” Are you that type of person or are you a type of person that wants more freedom in your life? And I think exploration, travel, it provides that.\n\nIn 1976 I had just finished my second year of college and realized that, after an experience in an elective acting class, that I wasn’t going to be the policeman I thought I was going to be. It was better if I didn’t continue on with two more years of an Administration of Justice major because I knew I wasn’t going to become a policeman.\n\nSo... I thought I better just go figure out what it is I want to do.\n\nAnd so I hopped on the back of a motorcycle. My brother was in the same position, really. Two young guys who were not quite sure what was in store for them or what avenue they should go down. So we both hopped on our motorcycles and we took off. We left California. I had about 150 bucks in my pocket or something. And soon ran low of funds and we had to get jobs along the way.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ySQaE_N2Hb8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ySQaE_N2Hb8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ySQaE_N2Hb8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ySQaE_N2Hb8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ySQaE_N2Hb8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Big Think","tags":["Big Think","BigThink","BigThink.com","Education","Educational","Lifelong Learning","EDU","Bryan Cranston","Peace Corps","travel","motorcycles","discipline","acting","self-discovery","police","Breaking Bad","Trumbo","Malcolm in the Middle","college","university","gap year","america","work ethic","youth","brotherhood","purpose","adventure"],"categoryId":"27","liveBroadcastContent":"none","defaultLanguage":"en","localized":{"title":"Bryan Cranston: One Thing All Young People Should Do While They're Still Young","description":"Travel—and experiencing other cultures—opens your mind.

Cook's Illustrated Senior Editor Dan Souza explains our cooking experiments.\n\nWATCH: How to Make the Most Perfect Bacon Ever https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guC4Badq2s\n\nWATCH: How to Quickly Defrost Meat\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a2hQpj6Dxc\n\nRecipe for Ultimate Charcoal-Grilled Steaks: http://cooks.io/2lsTUYe\nRecipe for Grilled Frozen Steaks: http://cooks.io/2lsXUYu\nRecipe for Pan-Seared Thick-Cut Strip Steaks: http://bit.ly/ULQJwD\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nWe cut a strip loin into eight steaks, cut each steak in half crosswise, put the pieces in vacuum-sealed bags, and froze them. We then thawed half of each steak in the refrigerator overnight and kept the other half frozen. Using our preferred method, we seared both sets of steaks in a hot skillet for 90 seconds per side and then transferred them to a 275-degree oven until they reached 125 degrees, or medium-rare. To track moisture loss, we weighed each steak before and after cooking.\n\nRESULTS\n\nNot surprisingly, the frozen steaks took longer to finish cooking through in the oven (18 to 22 minutes versus 10 to 15 minutes for the thawed steaks). What was surprising was that the frozen steaks actually browned in the skillet just as well as, and in the same amount of time as, the thawed steaks. Furthermore, they had thinner bands of gray, overcooked meat directly under the crust than the thawed steaks had. We also found that these steaks lost on average 9 percent less moisture during cooking than the thawed steaks did. Sampling the steaks side by side, tasters unanimously preferred the cooked-from-frozen steaks to their thawed counterparts.\n\nEXPLANATION\n\nA fully frozen steak is extremely cold, which prevents overcooking while the surface reaches the very high temperatures necessary for browning reactions. As for the difference in moisture loss, we know that when meat is cooked to temperatures higher than 140 degrees, its muscle fibers begin to squeeze out a significant amount of moisture. As its slightly thicker gray band indicated, the steak that had been thawed had more overcooking around the edge, so it made sense that it also had greater moisture loss.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nWhile we prefer to start with steak that’s never been frozen for the best texture, if we do have frozen steaks on hand, from now on we’ll cook them straight from the freezer. (But if you can choose between frozen vs. fresh, definitely go for fresh.)\n\nHere's what to do for the best frozen steaks: Freeze steaks, uncovered, overnight on a baking sheet (this dries them out to prevent excess splattering during cooking), then wrap them tightly in plastic wrap, place in a zipper-lock bag, and return to freezer. To ensure that the steaks brown evenly, add oil to the skillet until it measures 1/8 inch deep.

All the techniques and methods that were used during this project will be covered in detail during the House Building Series. Thank you Patrons!\n\nAs an aside... this was an exceptionally fun project for two reasons.\nFirst, the porch was fun to design and build because of the materials, style and the fact that it used several different crafts. \nSecond, Jeff and Debbie were among some of the best clients that I have ever worked for. They wanted it nice, they were good at making design choices with out changing their minds over and over, they were not shy about asking questions or objecting if I was not meeting the terms of the contract and they were not shy about expressing appreciation for good work. They bent over backwards to give me full access to the project and understood the delays caused by weather. Customers like these make contracting a pleasure, but they don't come along every day and so I treasure the chance to work for folks like this!\n\n\nEssential Craftsman T shirt Here https://goo.gl/5YqRrR\n\nMusic is by Simon Alexander.

Thank you Patrons!\n\nAs an aside... this was an exceptionally fun project for two reasons.\nFirst, the porch was fun to design and build because of the materials, style and the fact that it used several different crafts. \nSecond, Jeff and Debbie were among some of the best clients that I have ever worked for. They wanted it nice, they were good at making design choices with out changing their minds over and over, they were not shy about asking questions or objecting if I was not meeting the terms of the contract and they were not shy about expressing appreciation for good work. They bent over backwards to give me full access to the project and understood the delays caused by weather. Customers like these make contracting a pleasure, but they don't come along every day and so I treasure the chance to work for folks like this!\n\n\nEssential Craftsman T shirt Here https://goo.gl/5YqRrR\n\nMusic is by Simon Alexander.

For the record, this is TAS.\n\nThis video is an improvement from my previous video in which I collected this star in 1 A press. You can find that video here: https://youtu.be/yGic8wwhm6g. Since then, we discovered PU movement and scuttlebug raising, which made this strat possible.\n\nFor convenience, here are the informative parts of the video:\n0:35 for half A presses\n3:44 for scuttlebug transportation\n5:01 for scuttlebug raising\n8:07 for hyper speed walking (HSWing)\n10:40 for parallel universes (PUs)\n\nHere is a play by play of what I do. First, I use scuttlebug transportation to move a scuttlebug to the corner of the Watch for Rolling Rocks platform. Then, I use scuttlebug raising to raise him to about the height of the platform. Next, I use hyper speed walking to generate massive speed. Finally, I use PU movement to navigate to the top of the course, launch to the scuttlebug to bounce on him, and ground pound in the misalignment of the platform to get onto it.

The result? Over two-thirds of all men are smokers, and it is commonplace for children as young as six to take up the habit. Tobacco is a $100 billion industry here, with TV and print ads everywhere. Investigating this phenomenon in Malang, VICE visits a clinic that promises cures to a plethora of modern ailments through tobacco and smoking -- with our intrepid correspondent getting the full smoke-therapy treatment.\n\nSegment 2: Underground Heroin Clinic \n\nHeroin is the most addictive drug on earth, and some people will do anything to kick the habit. Enter Ibogaine -- a drug made out of the African iboga root, whose intense, hallucinogenic properties make it a Type-A felony drug. But many swear it's the most effective way to kick heroin addiction -- especially when combined with a voodoo-type ritual that involves face paint and chanting.

But Mike Merrill has taken this idea to its logical extreme.\n\nIn 2008, Merrill launched KMikeyM, a corporate-alter-ego-slash-trading-platform, where investors can purchase stock that gives them voting power over Merrill’s life choices.

(This is an exaggeration.) But the point is, where we see a crazy jumble of circuitry, Ken sees a riddle to be solved, and he's got a method that guides him through the madness.\n\nIn his talk at the 2016 Hackaday SuperConference, Ken stepped the audience through a number of famous chips, showing how he approaches them and how you could do the same if you wanted to, or needed to. Reading an IC from a photo is not for the faint of heart, but with a little perseverance, it can give you the keys to the kingdom.

But the point is, where we see a crazy jumble of circuitry, Ken sees a riddle to be solved, and he's got a method that guides him through the madness.\n\nIn his talk at the 2016 Hackaday SuperConference, Ken stepped the audience through a number of famous chips, showing how he approaches them and how you could do the same if you wanted to, or needed to. Reading an IC from a photo is not for the faint of heart, but with a little perseverance, it can give you the keys to the kingdom.

Includes terrific views of early types of jet engines and components including compressors, fans, combustion chambers, and so on.  At the 13 minute mark a variety of other uses for the turbine engine are shown including for power generation, fire fighting, marine propulsion, gas turbine locomotives, and more.  A prototype gas turbine car known as the Firebird is also shown at the 13:30 mark, probably at the Motorama, and at 15:40.  \n\nThe General Motors Firebird is a quartet of prototype cars designed by Harley Earl, and engineered by General Motors for the 1953, 1956 and 1959 Motorama auto shows. They were very much inspired by innovations in fighter aircraft design at the time. None of the designs were intended for production, but instead were to showcase the extremes in technology and design that General Motors was able to achieve. The cars were recently placed on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, and still make regular car show appearances.\n\nThe name \"Firebird\" was also used by the Pontiac division of General Motors for the line of pony cars, which has no direct relation to the concept cars.\n\nThe film includes footage of the prototype Boeing 707 aircraft in flight at the 15:30 mark.\n\nThe Wood River, Illinois facility of Shell Oil is also shown at the 15 minute mark, where jet fuels were exhaustively studied.  \n\nA gas turbine, also called a combustion turbine, is a type of internal combustion engine. It has an upstream rotating compressor coupled to a downstream turbine, and a combustion chamber in between.\n\nThe basic operation of the gas turbine is similar to that of the steam power plant except that air is used instead of water. Fresh atmospheric air flows through a compressor that brings it to higher pressure. Energy is then added by spraying fuel into the air and igniting it so the combustion generates a high-temperature flow. This high-temperature high-pressure gas enters a turbine, where it expands down to the exhaust pressure, producing a shaft work output in the process. The turbine shaft work is used to drive the compressor and other devices such as an electric generator that may be coupled to the shaft. The energy that is not used for shaft work comes out in the exhaust gases, so these have either a high temperature or a high velocity. The purpose of the gas turbine determines the design so that the most desirable energy form is maximized. Gas turbines are used to power aircraft, trains, ships, electrical generators, or even tanks.\n\nAirbreathing jet engines are gas turbines optimized to produce thrust from the exhaust gases, or from ducted fans connected to the gas turbines. Jet engines that produce thrust from the direct impulse of exhaust gases are often called turbojets, whereas those that generate thrust with the addition of a ducted fan are often called turbofans or (rarely) fan-jets.\n\nGas turbines are also used in many liquid propellant rockets, the gas turbines are used to power a turbopump to permit the use of lightweight, low pressure tanks, which saves considerable dry mass.\n\nTurboprop engines[edit]\nA turboprop engine is a type of turbine engine which drives an external aircraft propeller using a reduction gear. Turboprop engines are generally used on small subsonic aircraft, but some large military and civil aircraft, such as the Airbus A400M, Lockheed L-188 Electra and Tupolev Tu-95, have also used turboprop power.\n\nWe encourage viewers to add comments and, especially, to provide additional information about our videos by adding a comment!  See something interesting?  Tell people what it is and what they can see by writing something for example like: \"01:00:12:00 -- President Roosevelt is seen meeting with Winston Churchill at the Quebec Conference.\"\n\nThis film is part of the Periscope Film LLC archive, one of the largest historic military, transportation, and aviation stock footage collections in the USA.

We find out why.\n\nClick here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 \n\nSand is crucial for construction. Much of the global economy relies on it. We use 40 billion tonnes of it each year to build our cities and towns. But global reserves are running low.\n\nWHY IS SAND IN SHORT SUPPLY?\nIndustrial sand and gravel are the world’s most extracted materials. They are essential for the production of cement, concrete and asphalt. Global demand for sand has almost doubled since 2004.\n\nAnd as the world becomes more populated and urbanised, demand will continue to rise. 70% of the world’s annual supply of sand goes to Asia.\n\nChina used more cement between 2011 and 2013 than America did during the entire 20th century. However, the biggest importers are countries covered in sand – the Gulf States. \n\nSand from the Gulf region is too fine for use in construction.\nThe Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai was built using imported Australian sand.\n\nSand is produced from the weathering of rocks, corals and shells. Natural reserves took millions of years to build up. And now they are being depleted more quickly than they can be replenished.\n\nBut 40 billion tones are needed globally each year. Reserves are being depleted quicker than they can be replenished. \n\nExtracting sand takes its toll on the environment. Dredging rivers and seas for sand destroys natural habitats, pollutes waterways, and affects local fishing and farming industries.\n\nAnd our insatiable demand is set to rise. Global construction is forecast to grow 3.9%  each year until 2030.\n\nWhen current reserves are depleted, there will still be plenty of sand left in the world. But extracting it will be more difficult, more expensive, and more damaging to the environment.\n\nIn the future we might need to find a new material to build our concrete jungles.\n\nDaily Watch: mind-stretching short films throughout the working week.\n\nFor more from Economist Films visit: http://films.economist.com/ \nCheck out The Economist’s full video catalogue: http://econ.st/20IehQk \nLike The Economist on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheEconomist/ \nFollow The Economist on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theeconomist \nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/theeconomist/ \nFollow us on LINE: http://econ.st/1WXkOo6 \nFollow us on Medium: https://medium.com/@the_economist","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8J78ezpadFo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8J78ezpadFo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8J78ezpadFo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8J78ezpadFo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"The Economist","tags":["Sand","construction","environment","architecture","natural resources","why is sand in short supply","sand shortage","why sand is in short supply","sand supply","sand supply business","the economist","economist","economist films","economist magazine","economist video"],"categoryId":"25","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Why is sand in short supply? | The Economist","description":"The world uses 40 billion tonnes of sand each year to build cities and towns, but global reserves are running low.

The Tupolev TU-144 flew even faster than the Concorde and it carried more passengers. What happened to this aircraft and why have so few heard about it?\n\nGetting the TU-144 built before the Concorde (and therefore proving Soviet superiority to the world) was allegedly a high priority for the Soviets. The plane was developed under a tight schedule and relied on a few less advanced aviation technologies. The TU-144 suffered three known crashes, the most famous being at the 1973 Paris Air Show (there are conflicting theories on the cause of the 1973 crash).  In regular passenger service, the TU-144 proved unreliable. Only one flight a week was permitted on a single route between Moscow and Almaty, Kazakhstan. It is rumoured that Soviet leaders were nervous about the 144's airworthiness and ordered it's chief designer Alexei Tupolev to personally inspect every 144. \n\nSupersonic travel proved expensive and could only be offered as a 'premium' product in commercial airline travel.

The Tupolev TU-144 flew even faster than the Concorde and it carried more passengers. What happened to this aircraft and why have so few heard about it?\n\nGetting the TU-144 built before the Concorde (and therefore proving Soviet superiority to the world) was allegedly a high priority for the Soviets. The plane was developed under a tight schedule and relied on a few less advanced aviation technologies. The TU-144 suffered three known crashes, the most famous being at the 1973 Paris Air Show (there are conflicting theories on the cause of the 1973 crash).  In regular passenger service, the TU-144 proved unreliable. Only one flight a week was permitted on a single route between Moscow and Almaty, Kazakhstan. It is rumoured that Soviet leaders were nervous about the 144's airworthiness and ordered it's chief designer Alexei Tupolev to personally inspect every 144. \n\nSupersonic travel proved expensive and could only be offered as a 'premium' product in commercial airline travel. In west, the Concorde could be marketed as a luxury product to serve the wealthy and airfares could be sold at prices well beyond typical airfares. In the communist Soviet Union, where egalitarian principles demanded that displays of wealth or class be subdued, the TU-144 airfare had to be set similar to the typical Soviet airfare. This meant that the 144 had to be operated at a loss for Aeroflot, and Aeroflot couldn't wait to stop flying it.\n\nThe TU-144 was removed from regular passenger service less than a year after it began (although cargo service was offered for a couple more years).

I got the Oxidising Agent and the Reducing Agent the wrong way around! Sodium is the Reducing agent and Chlorine is the Oxidising agent. My confusion was that when a sodium atom looses an electron it becomes oxidised, so in my simple brain, I called it the oxidising agent. That is wrong because the agent that oxidises the sodium is the chlorine atom and so the labels are the wrong way around. Doh!\n2. I drew the hydrogen H2 molecule with a double bond but it should be a single bond because they are bonded with a single covalent bond.\n3. Where I have drawn carbon dioxide, the carbon should have a double bond to each of the oxygens.\n4. Apparently Feynman diagrams are not that useful for theoretical chemistry, so perhaps that wasn't the best choice for the illustration. The feedback in the comments from a real theoretical chemist is \"All we deal with is shuffling around electrons, but many many many electrons, so a Feynman diagram would need to be huge but at the same time would be very very repetitive.\"\n5. In analytical chemistry, I should have called it distillation rather than precipitation.\n6. My definition of organic chemistry being about ‘life’ is not very good. I should have said that organic chemistry looks at compounds that contain carbon. But there are some compounds in inorganic chemistry that also contain carbon, like carbon dioxide so I guess I'd also have to state that inorganic chemistry is almost everything else.\n7. I said that fuels are inorganic chemistry which is misleading when I drew a car next to it. My understanding is that there are inorganic fuels that don't contain carbon, but obviously all the fuels we are familiar with are organic. I thought a picture of a car would tie a few things together elegantly, but it ended up giving the wrong impression. That’s okay, I’m still learning! :D\n8. In inorganic chemistry, I should have stated that all natural minerals fall under inorganic chemistry so as not to be misleading, otherwise you might go way thinking that only man-made substances fall under inorganic chemistry which is not true. I said that 'a lot of the inorganic compounds that are studied are man-made' meaning that the cutting edge of research is mostly man-made substances.\n9. Apparently water is not the most inflammable substance. I thought it was so that is interesting.\n10.

I got the Oxidising Agent and the Reducing Agent the wrong way around! Sodium is the Reducing agent and Chlorine is the Oxidising agent. My confusion was that when a sodium atom looses an electron it becomes oxidised, so in my simple brain, I called it the oxidising agent. That is wrong because the agent that oxidises the sodium is the chlorine atom and so the labels are the wrong way around. Doh!\n2. I drew the hydrogen H2 molecule with a double bond but it should be a single bond because they are bonded with a single covalent bond.\n3. Where I have drawn carbon dioxide, the carbon should have a double bond to each of the oxygens.\n4. Apparently Feynman diagrams are not that useful for theoretical chemistry, so perhaps that wasn't the best choice for the illustration. The feedback in the comments from a real theoretical chemist is \"All we deal with is shuffling around electrons, but many many many electrons, so a Feynman diagram would need to be huge but at the same time would be very very repetitive.\"\n5. In analytical chemistry, I should have called it distillation rather than precipitation.\n6. My definition of organic chemistry being about ‘life’ is not very good. I should have said that organic chemistry looks at compounds that contain carbon. But there are some compounds in inorganic chemistry that also contain carbon, like carbon dioxide so I guess I'd also have to state that inorganic chemistry is almost everything else.\n7. I said that fuels are inorganic chemistry which is misleading when I drew a car next to it. My understanding is that there are inorganic fuels that don't contain carbon, but obviously all the fuels we are familiar with are organic. I thought a picture of a car would tie a few things together elegantly, but it ended up giving the wrong impression. That’s okay, I’m still learning! :D\n8. In inorganic chemistry, I should have stated that all natural minerals fall under inorganic chemistry so as not to be misleading, otherwise you might go way thinking that only man-made substances fall under inorganic chemistry which is not true. I said that 'a lot of the inorganic compounds that are studied are man-made' meaning that the cutting edge of research is mostly man-made substances.\n9. Apparently water is not the most inflammable substance. I thought it was so that is interesting.\n10. In the bonding section, hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces are technically inter molecular forces.\n\nHere are some of the references I used for this video if you’d like to dig a little deeper\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_chemistry\nhttps://www.uwlax.edu/chemistry-and-biochemistry/student-resources/different-types-of-chemistry/\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry\nhttps://www.cancerquest.org/cancer-biology/biological-building-blocks\nEarly smelting:\nhttp://ispatguru.com/evolution-of-blast-furnace-iron-making/\nCategorisation of reactions\nhttp://www2.ucdsb.on.ca/tiss/stretton/chem1/stoich2.html\nAnd The Great Courses Plus have lots of great videos: http://ow.ly/crsQ30beNOZ\n‘The Great Courses Plus is currently available to watch through a web browser to almost anyone in the world and optimized for the US market.

I’ll be doing some testing to see if this is actually true in a later video. \n\nOur first step in changing out the brakes is to loosen the wheel lug nuts. Next, we need to lift the wheels off the ground. Be sure to locate the proper jacking points in your owners manual before lifting the car. With the car raised, we can remove the wheels and access the brakes.Starting at the front, first we need to remove the brake caliper to get access to the rotor. To remove the caliper piston & brake pads, there are two bolts on the backside of the caliper. Use a wrench to hold the caliper pin in place, while using a socket wrench to remove the bolts. After removing these two bolts, you can pull the caliper free - set it aside and be sure not to let it hang from the brake line. You can now also remove the two brake pads.\n\nNext, we’ll remove the caliper bracket. There are two screws to remove, and then it can be pulled free. With complete access, now we can start removing the brake rotor. Usually there are two screws which hold it in, which if they’re old will likely be rusted at this point. Using a screwdriver and a mallet or hammer, give the rusted screws several hammer taps to help disturb the rust. Then, using a screwdriver, or perhaps an impact wrench if needed, remove the two screws. If nothing seems to get them to budge, you can simply drill out the screws so they’re no longer fastening the rotor.\n\nAt this point, the rotor is free to remove, but it’s likely that rust will hold it in place. There are two bolt holes to break it from the rust. Using the bolts from the caliper, screw them into the rotor, and slowly tighten each bolt, alternating back and forth, until the rotor finally breaks away.\n\nBefore installing the new rotor, spray both sides with brake cleaner to remove any protective oil or residue that may be left on the surface. On the hub where the brake rotor rests, rust can build up, so I’m using a wire brush on a drill bit to remove some of the rust and clean up the hub a bit. Slide the new rotor in place, aligning the orientation with the screw holes. You can use a single lug nut to hold the rotor in place while you assemble the brake caliper.\n\nNext we’ll put the brake caliper bracket back in place using the two bolts. Honda’s torque spec for these bolts is 79.6 lb-ft. (108 N-m). With the new brake pads, Honda recommends applying Molykote M77 or Daikalub 528D to the back and sides of the backing plate, as well as on the back of the shims. If your pads came with new hardware, replace the clips in caliper bracket, and then slide the brake pads in place. Make sure not to get any grease on the rotors or pad face.\n\nNow we need to push the piston back into the caliper. Before doing so, it’s a good idea to wipe down the surface & exposed sides of the piston. Then place the old brake pad against the piston, and using a brake pad piston compressor, press the piston back into place. It shouldn’t require much effort, and once the effort gets high, the piston is likely flush with the caliper and you can stop. I bought this tool for $8 from Harbor Freight, and it works just fine.\n\nNext, be sure the brake caliper pins are lubricated and can rotate freely. It’s a good idea to inspect these and apply grease as necessary. Slide the caliper over the brake pads, and torque down the two bolts to 24 lb-ft (32 N-m). Now we can put the wheel back on, and tighten down the lug nuts. Because the car is lifted, we’ll need to wait until it’s lowered again to apply the correct torque. \n\nEngineering Explained is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com. \n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below!\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained\nOfficial Website: http://www.howdoesacarwork.com\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/jasonfenske13\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained\nCar Throttle: https://www.carthrottle.com/user/engineeringexplained\nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA\n\nNEW VIDEO EVERY WEDNESDAY!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ml4WyK_piRM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ml4WyK_piRM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ml4WyK_piRM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ml4WyK_piRM/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ml4WyK_piRM/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Engineering Explained","tags":["brake pads","brake rotors","honda","s2000","replace brakes","how to brakes","brake testing","brembo","caliper","4 piston","6 piston","directional brake rotors","performance rotors","honda diy","diy","how to","chrisfix","engineering explained","s2k","quickjack","bendpak"],"categoryId":"2","liveBroadcastContent":"none","defaultLanguage":"en","localized":{"title":"How To Replace Brake Pads And Rotors (Front & Rear)","description":"How To Install Brake Pads & Rotors On A Honda S2000\nQuickJack -  https://www.quickjack.com/\nSubscribe for new videos every Wednesday! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7\n\nProducts Used:\nQuickJack -  http://amzn.to/2sfGmXV (5,000 lb in video)\nBrake Piston Tool - http://amzn.to/2tWIFMv\nSilicon Paste For Brake Pins - http://amzn.to/2tWbHvG\nMolykote M77 - http://amzn.to/2sZgNri\nAluminum Anti-Sieze - http://amzn.to/2sg4Ccj\nCopper Anti-Sieze - http://amzn.to/2sfTxI8\nBrake Pads - http://bit.ly/2tn0WFO\nFront Brake Rotors - http://bit.ly/2sfprEZ\nRear Brake Rotors - http://amzn.to/2sZS9Xu\n\nI’ve picked out some rotors with directional vanes, rather than straight vanes, which supposedly offer better cooling as they help pump air through the brakes, which leads to less brake fade.

The tunnel will carry traffic from the Alaskan Way Viaduct, which had been damaged and deemed seismically unsafe after an earthquake.

Natural draft is the flow of air through a furnace due to rising hot air. The hot gasses in the fuel bed are more buoyant than the cold air outside the furnace causing them to rise. Fresh combustion air then enters the base of the furnace to replace the rising combustion gasses, keeping the fuel bed burning. This effect increases with: 1. the average temperature of the fuel bed relative to the outside air and 2. The height of the furnace. Two other important factors are the size of the tuyere (air entry pipe) and lump size of the fuel bed as these effect the resistance to airflow through the furnace. The furnace was tested with wood fuel and some ore was melted but produced no iron. High temperature were indeed produced (probably about 1200 c). These types of furnaces were once used for smelting copper and iron ores in around the world in ancient times, usually using charcoal as a fuel and in some cases wood too.\nI designed the furnace using a formula from the book “The mastery and uses of fire in antiquity” by J.E. Rehder. It was designed to have a space velocity (air speed within the furnace) of 6 m per minute which is recommended for iron smelting. The furnace was 175 cm in total height but with a height of only 150 cm above the tuyere. The height between the air entry and the top of the furnace is what determines the strength of the draft, the space beneath the air entry is not included in the formula. The internal furnace diameter was 25 cm. The walls were about 12.5 cm thick at the base but got thinner with height. The tuyere (air entry pipe) was 7.5 cm internal diameter and about 20 cm long. The tuyere was placed into an opening in the base of the furnace and sealed with mud. The whole thing took about a week to make due to the slow drying time that was assisted by keeping a fire burning in side it. The furnace was designed to use charcoal (which in this case should be 2.5 cm diameter lumps) but I used wood to test it instead as it was easier to acquire. To test its melting ability, bog ore was found further down the creek and roasted. The roasted ore was then crushed and stored in a pot. \nThe furnace was filled with wood and lit from the top. The fire burnt down the furnace producing charcoal. On reaching the tuyere the fire then started burning the charcoal. Wood was also continually added from the top along with a few small handfuls of the roasted bog ore (not shown in the video). The temperature of hot objects can be visually estimated from their incandescence.  After about an hour, the light coming out of the tuyere was high yellow to white hot indicating a temperature of at about 1200 c. Colour temperature charts vary but white hot is usually given to be at least 1200 c, examples of these charts can be found on the internet for reference. It was uncomfortable to stare into the tuyere and doing so left an after image when looking away, indicating the strength of its brightness. After about an hour and a half the furnace was left to burn out. When opened the next day the tuyere was covered in slag with bits of slag found on the furnace floor also. \nThis experiment shows that high temperatures can be achieved without the use of bellows or charcoal, which might significantly reduce labour in the production of iron. The furnace was technically easy to build as it was a simple vertical cylinder. When running, the wood added to the top of the furnace converts to charcoal in the upper part of the stack and is consumed in the lower part. The ore I used was new to me, normally I use iron bacteria as an ore. This new ore produced no metallic iron so I’m inclined to use iron bacteria in future. Natural draft furnaces were once used to smelt copper and iron ores in the past, usually with charcoal fuel and less frequently with wood. The main benefit of these furnaces seems to have been the reduction in labour they provide and simplified infrastructure (fewer workers and no bellows required during operation).","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u7wAJTGl2gc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u7wAJTGl2gc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u7wAJTGl2gc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u7wAJTGl2gc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u7wAJTGl2gc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Primitive Technology","categoryId":"22","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Primitive Technology: Natural Draft Furnace","description":"I built a natural draft furnace to test ideas about how hot a furnace could get without the use of bellows. Natural draft is the flow of air through a furnace due to rising hot air. The hot gasses in the fuel bed are more buoyant than the cold air outside the furnace causing them to rise. Fresh combustion air then enters the base of the furnace to replace the rising combustion gasses, keeping the fuel bed burning. This effect increases with: 1. the average temperature of the fuel bed relative to the outside air and 2. The height of the furnace. Two other important factors are the size of the tuyere (air entry pipe) and lump size of the fuel bed as these effect the resistance to airflow through the furnace.

If the term is unfamiliar, there’s a high chance you have still encountered this common powertrain affliction.\n\nThis is the experience with many turbocharged engines, when there’s a delay between the driver pressing the throttle and the engine responding as it waits for the turbine to supply its performance boost.\n\nVolvo’s D5 twin-turbocharged four-cylinder diesel engine, however, features an ingenious solution.

It combines an electrically driven compressor and a pressurised air tank to ensure immediate, on-demand acceleration.\n\nWhen the driver requests rapid momentum by pressing harder on the throttle pedal, compressed air from the tank is released into the exhaust system feeding the turbo to quicken response.\n\nAnd because Volvo’s Drive-E powertrains are engineered to deliver efficient power, the PowerPulse technology is a performance benefit that doesn’t come at the expense of fuel consumption.\n\nThe D5 twin-turbo diesel engine with PowerPulse is currently available on Volvo’s 90-series models, including the XC90, S90, and forthcoming V90 Cross Country.\"\nSource: https://www.volvocars.com/au/about/australia/i-roll-enewsletter/2017/february/pulsating-technology\n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below!\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained\nOfficial Website: http://www.howdoesacarwork.com\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/jasonfenske13\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained\nCar Throttle: https://www.carthrottle.com/user/engineeringexplained\nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA\n\nNEW VIDEO EVERY WEDNESDAY!"},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT3M35S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"true","licensedContent":true,"projection":"rectangular"},"statistics":{"viewCount":312116,"likeCount":10603,"dislikeCount":126,"favoriteCount":0,"commentCount":1248},"ratio":84.15079365079364,"score":26264809.11111111,"_id":"kQrsPSI4auy1F9gd"}

Learn to Set Systems Instead. | Adam Alter","description":"You've just achieved a goal you've been working towards for two years. You did it! Congratulations. Someone asks you: how does it feel? \"Kind of anti-climactic, actually,\" you say. This scenario is quite common among those who have achieved even the highest benchmarks in business, athletics, or art, says Adam Alter, and it's because the goal setting process is broken. With long-term goals particularly, you spend the large majority of the time in a failure state, awaiting what could be a mere second of success down the track. This can be a hollow and unrewarding process. Alter suggests swapping quantitative goals (I will write 1,000 words of my novel per day. I will run 1km further every week) for qualitative systems—like writing every morning with no word target, or running in a new environment each week—that nourish you psychologically, and are independently rewarding each time you do them. Adam Alter is the author of Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked.\n\nRead more at BigThink.com: http://bigthink.com/videos/adam-alter-want-to-succeed-dont-set-goals-set-systems\n\nFollow Big Think here:\nYouTube: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcom\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthink\n\nTranscript: Goal setting is fascinating because it's sort of a broken process in many respects. This is the way a goal works: You say to yourself, “When I achieve (whatever the thing is), that's how I'll know I'll have succeeded, and I'm going to do everything I can to get to that point as quickly as possible.” What that means is you exist in a failure state for a long time until you reach that goal, if it's a long-range goal. And so as you evaluate your process all you get is the negative feedback of not having achieved that goal. Perhaps as you move closer to it there's some positive feedback, but if the goal is really the end state that you're seeking out, there's a lot of failure before you get there. And now here's the thing: when you do get there it's a massive anti-climax.\n\nSo there are people who achieve the highest highs; people who achieve the highest highs in athletics, in business, and if you talk to them and you ask them to describe what it's like to reach their goals they say things like, “I got there and it was an incredible anti-climax. The minute I got there I had to start something new, I had to find a new goal.” And that's partly because there's something really unsatisfying about the moment of reaching the goal. Unless it has its own benefits that come from reaching the goal, if it's just a sort of signpost; that doesn't do much for us, it doesn't nourish us psychologically. And what that ends up meaning is that we have to try to find something new.\n\nSo really if you look at life as a series of goals, which for many of us it is, it's a period of being unsuccessful in achieving the goal, then hitting the goal, then feeling like you haven't really got much from that goal, going to the next one—and it's a sort of series of escalating goals.\nA really good example of this is, say, smart watches or Fitbits or exercise watches. People, when they get those watches, a lot of them hit on the number 10,000. “I want to walk 10,000 steps.” When you do that, the thing will beep; you'll feel pretty good about it for a minute but then that feels a little hollow and the goal escalates over time. People will describe going from 10 to 11 to 12 to 14,000 steps to the point where they're moving through injuries, through stress-related injuries, because the goal is there; they respond to the goal more than they do to their internal cues, and basically there's something really unfulfilling about that.\n\nThe reason the goal keeps escalating and becoming more and more intense is because when they achieve the goal they don't actually get anything for that achievement, and so goals, generally I think, are in many ways broken processes.\n\nI think part of the problem with goals is that they don't tell you how to get to where you're going. A better thing to do is to use a system. So the idea behind a system rather than a goal is that a system is saying things like, “I’m a writer, my goal is to finish writing this book but I'm not going to think about it in that way. Eventually I'll have 100,000 words, but my system will be that for an hour every morning I will sit in front of my computer screen and I will type. It doesn't matter what that looks like.

Learn to Set Systems Instead. | Adam Alter","description":"You've just achieved a goal you've been working towards for two years. You did it! Congratulations. Someone asks you: how does it feel? \"Kind of anti-climactic, actually,\" you say. This scenario is quite common among those who have achieved even the highest benchmarks in business, athletics, or art, says Adam Alter, and it's because the goal setting process is broken. With long-term goals particularly, you spend the large majority of the time in a failure state, awaiting what could be a mere second of success down the track. This can be a hollow and unrewarding process. Alter suggests swapping quantitative goals (I will write 1,000 words of my novel per day. I will run 1km further every week) for qualitative systems—like writing every morning with no word target, or running in a new environment each week—that nourish you psychologically, and are independently rewarding each time you do them. Adam Alter is the author of Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked.\n\nRead more at BigThink.com: http://bigthink.com/videos/adam-alter-want-to-succeed-dont-set-goals-set-systems\n\nFollow Big Think here:\nYouTube: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcom\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthink\n\nTranscript: Goal setting is fascinating because it's sort of a broken process in many respects. This is the way a goal works: You say to yourself, “When I achieve (whatever the thing is), that's how I'll know I'll have succeeded, and I'm going to do everything I can to get to that point as quickly as possible.” What that means is you exist in a failure state for a long time until you reach that goal, if it's a long-range goal. And so as you evaluate your process all you get is the negative feedback of not having achieved that goal. Perhaps as you move closer to it there's some positive feedback, but if the goal is really the end state that you're seeking out, there's a lot of failure before you get there. And now here's the thing: when you do get there it's a massive anti-climax.\n\nSo there are people who achieve the highest highs; people who achieve the highest highs in athletics, in business, and if you talk to them and you ask them to describe what it's like to reach their goals they say things like, “I got there and it was an incredible anti-climax. The minute I got there I had to start something new, I had to find a new goal.” And that's partly because there's something really unsatisfying about the moment of reaching the goal. Unless it has its own benefits that come from reaching the goal, if it's just a sort of signpost; that doesn't do much for us, it doesn't nourish us psychologically. And what that ends up meaning is that we have to try to find something new.\n\nSo really if you look at life as a series of goals, which for many of us it is, it's a period of being unsuccessful in achieving the goal, then hitting the goal, then feeling like you haven't really got much from that goal, going to the next one—and it's a sort of series of escalating goals.\nA really good example of this is, say, smart watches or Fitbits or exercise watches. People, when they get those watches, a lot of them hit on the number 10,000. “I want to walk 10,000 steps.” When you do that, the thing will beep; you'll feel pretty good about it for a minute but then that feels a little hollow and the goal escalates over time. People will describe going from 10 to 11 to 12 to 14,000 steps to the point where they're moving through injuries, through stress-related injuries, because the goal is there; they respond to the goal more than they do to their internal cues, and basically there's something really unfulfilling about that.\n\nThe reason the goal keeps escalating and becoming more and more intense is because when they achieve the goal they don't actually get anything for that achievement, and so goals, generally I think, are in many ways broken processes.\n\nI think part of the problem with goals is that they don't tell you how to get to where you're going. A better thing to do is to use a system. So the idea behind a system rather than a goal is that a system is saying things like, “I’m a writer, my goal is to finish writing this book but I'm not going to think about it in that way. Eventually I'll have 100,000 words, but my system will be that for an hour every morning I will sit in front of my computer screen and I will type. It doesn't matter what that looks like. I'm not going to evaluate the number of words. I'm not going to set some benchmark, some artificial number or benchmark that I should reach, what I'm going to do is just say, 'Here's my system: an hour a day in front of the screen. I'll do what I can—bam.'”"},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT3M50S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":true,"projection":"rectangular"},"statistics":{"viewCount":430324,"likeCount":19787,"dislikeCount":530,"favoriteCount":0,"commentCount":624},"_id":"nZ4LR4TJevnOSBin","ratio":37.33396226415094,"score":16065699.97735849}

Which means the ship looked like - This.\n\nWith some luck, Titan Salvage were able to tug the ship to Unalaska Island, where it was finally “righted”, meaning the ship was no longer tilted, then it was towed to Portland, Oregon for inspections and repair.\n\nThis incident was quite the nightmare for Mazda.

This was already very bad for the local environment and reef, but things got even worse when the Rena started leaking oil. Because of bad weather, the crew of 20 was evacuated, when the ship started shifting.\n\nA few days later, the oil spill was declared the worst maritime environmental disaster of New Zealand, and people were rightly pissed.\n\nA few days later, the ship was sitting at a 20 degree tilt, and 88 of the cargo containers fell into the sea.\n\nIn January 2012, the ship finally succumbed to the sea and broke in 2.  By 2014, 77% of the cargo was removed, and major parts of the ship were salvaged. \n\nSo what is happening today? NOTHING.

All power was lost and the ship drifted towards the shore and rolled towards the starboard side.\n\nAfter rescue operations were over, it came time to figure out what could be salvaged from the ship. Smit International, a salvage company assessed that the best course of action was the total write off of the ship as a constructive loss, they were contracted to remove the fuel from the ship.\n\nIn 2013, the ship was finally brought back to a vertical position, and the salvage costs rose up to $799 million in total. At which point I assume the people doing the estimates said to themselves “Screw it, lets just round up to $800 million”.\n\nIn 2014, the ship was refloated and prepped for towing, estimates for the total cost rose to $2 Billion. \n\nIn July 2017, the final pieces of the Costa Concordia were scrapped and recycled, finishing the story of this tragic event.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-NnlEC7pBKk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-NnlEC7pBKk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-NnlEC7pBKk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-NnlEC7pBKk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"World Unearthed","tags":["biggest","salvage","projects","in the world","deepwater horizon rig","giant","abandoned","ships","big","huge","costa concordia","shipping","engineering","fails","missions","mystery","mysterious","ghost ship","abandoned ships","rescue missions","environment","discovered","crusie ship","found","strangest","weirdest","strange","weird","bizarre","shocking","engineering fails","you won't believe","engineering marvels","stranded ships","salvaged ships","saving","exploring","surviving","world's biggest","world unearthed"],"categoryId":"24","liveBroadcastContent":"none","defaultLanguage":"en","localized":{"title":"BIGGEST Salvage Projects In The World","description":"From the Deepwater Horizon Rig event to giant abandoned ships; these are the BIGGEST Salvage Projects in The World !\n\n\nCheck me out on Facebook- http://bit.ly/2isFYRd \nThere are more awesome videos being made every week, like and subscribe to World Unearthed so you don't miss a beat !\n\n7.MV Cougar Ace | Alaska\n\nThe Singaporean vessel Cougar Ace is primarily used for transporting cars from Japan to North America.

At which point I assume the people doing the estimates said to themselves “Screw it, lets just round up to $800 million”.\n\nIn 2014, the ship was refloated and prepped for towing, estimates for the total cost rose to $2 Billion. \n\nIn July 2017, the final pieces of the Costa Concordia were scrapped and recycled, finishing the story of this tragic event."},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M4S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"false","licensedContent":true,"projection":"rectangular"},"statistics":{"viewCount":325309,"likeCount":2450,"dislikeCount":274,"favoriteCount":0,"commentCount":182},"_id":"phQMasooYjMgfYjr","ratio":8.941605839416058,"score":2908784.8540145983}

Since last October, an unusually high number of babies have been born there with small heads and a host of health problems like convulsions, suspected of being caused by a Zika virus infection early in their mother’s pregnancy.\n\n---+ What diseases can I get from mosquitoes in the United States?\nWest Nile virus is the most important of several mosquito-transmitted viruses now native to the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control.\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes:\n\nThe Bombardier Beetle And Its Crazy Chemical Cannon\nhttps://youtu.be/BWwgLS5tK80\n\n--- See also this new Zika video from PBS Digital Studios:\n\nShould You Be Worried About Zika? | It's Okay to Be Smart\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ9S_3RFBgc\n\n---+ About KQED\n\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.

Anything but the state-run TV channels is prohibited. Publications are limited to the state-approved newspapers and magazines. This is the law. But, in typical Cuban fashion, the law doesn't stop a vast underground system of entertainment and news media distributors and consumers.\n\n\"El Paquete Semanal\" (The Weekly Package) is a weekly trove of digital content—everything from American movies to PDFs of Spanish newspapers—that is gathered, organized and transferred by a human web of runners and dealers to the entire country.
